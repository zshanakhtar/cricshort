      "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>Match 57 of the TATA IPL 2025 sets the stage for a dramatic showdown at the iconic Eden Gardens as Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) take on Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in a clash of survival versus pride. For KKR, this is a must-win encounter to keep their playoff hopes alive, while CSK, already eliminated from contention, will look to play spoilsport and end their campaign on a high.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\n<strong>KKR enters this contest with everything to fight for. A win here would significantly improve their position on the points table and keep them in the playoff race. They&#39;ve shown flair in the powerplay this season, scoring at a rate of 9.8 runs per over&mdash;the third-best in the tournament. This aggressive approach at the top has laid solid foundations, something they&rsquo;ll aim to replicate in this high-pressure encounter.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\n<strong>CSK, on the other hand, have had a disappointing season by their standards. With nothing left to lose, they&rsquo;ll be playing for pride and legacy. The five-time champions have struggled especially during the powerplay, posting the lowest scoring rate of all teams at just 8.1 runs per over. Their struggles have continued into the middle overs as well, where they, along with KKR, are the only two sides averaging less than 8 runs per over.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Despite their current form, both teams share a rich history in the IPL, having delivered some of the tournament&rsquo;s most memorable matches. With contrasting motivations&mdash;KKR eyeing survival and CSK playing with freedom&mdash;this encounter promises intensity, emotion, and high-quality cricket.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\n<strong>Can KKR rise under pressure and keep their playoff dreams alive, or will CSK&#39;s fearless approach spoil the party? With Eden Gardens buzzing and the stakes high, Match 57 could be one of the most gripping contests of the season.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (39)_1746560579.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\nIPL Stats at Eden Gardens in 2025:<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (22)_1746624196.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>Pitch Report (Deep Dasgupta &amp; Aaron Finch):<\/strong><br \/>\nIt&#39;s the last league game in Kolkata. It&#39;s a bit muggy but breezy as well. The pitch being used tonight is right at the center of the square. The boundary to the right is 62 meters, to the left it&#39;s 64 meters, and straight down it&#39;s 75 meters. This pitch looks a bit tacky and slightly patchy, with some loose areas that suggest there might be inconsistent pace and possibly some turn later in the game. Even though the surface looks a bit up and down, this has been a high-scoring venue, with an average score of 200. The new ball will be crucial&mdash;teams will need to make the most of the powerplay to set a strong platform. Interestingly, four of the five finished games here have been won by the team batting first. With quality spinners in both teams, putting runs on the board early could be key. Despite the surface&#39;s unpredictable nature, 200 is still an achievable total, and teams might lean toward batting first to take advantage of early scoring opportunities and then let the spinners exploit conditions later in the innings.<\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (53)_1746625288.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\n<strong>Toss Update: <\/strong><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>KKR won the toss and elected to bat first!&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

In a match filled with momentum shifts, it was CSK&rsquo;s composure and firepower under pressure that made the difference.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Batting first, KKR posted a competitive 179\/6. Ajinkya Rahane played a captain&rsquo;s knock of 48 off 33 balls, supported by Andre Russell&rsquo;s blistering 38 off 21. Manish Pandey chipped in with an unbeaten 36, while Narine and Gurbaz provided quick starts. For CSK, Noor Ahmad was the pick of the bowlers, scalping 4 for 31 and pegging KKR back in the middle overs.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>CSK&rsquo;s chase began on a shaky note with two early wickets. But debutant Urvil Patel announced his arrival in style, hammering a scintillating 31 off just 11 deliveries, including four massive sixes. His counterattack shifted the pressure back onto KKR. Dewald Brevis then took charge with a fiery 52 off 25, while Shivam Dube added a steady 45.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>As the match tightened, CSK needed 8 runs off the final over. MS Dhoni, ever the finisher, smashed a vintage six over long-on on the first ball, tilting the match CSK&#39;s way. After a minor hiccup, young Anshul Kamboj calmly struck the winning boundary to seal the chase with two balls to spare.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/image (92)_1746641913.png\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\nAjinkya Rahane (Kolkata Knight Riders Captain)<\/strong>:<br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>&quot;I think it was a real tough thing to be on the losing side. I think we were 10-15 runs short. The bowlers bowled really well. It was a great game but tough to be on the losing side. Absolutely. This format, that is bound to happen. One over here and there and it changes the game. Dube and Brevis played well. They took their chances and it paid off. It&#39;s about being brave. No complaints. The bowlers tried their best. We will try to win two in two and that will take us to 15. Let&#39;s see where we go from there.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>MS Dhoni (Chennai Super Kings Captain):<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>&quot;It&#39;s good to be on the winning side, you know. We got a lot of things correct tonight and I can obviously get emotional about it because of the pride factor. I felt that what was important is that we wanted to be practical about it. We wanted to fill in the 25 players in the squad. We want to be more competitive but also want to look into the next year. We also want to look into the right combinations, which bowler can bowl which overs according to the conditions. The batting order was not right earlier but now the intent is really good in the batters. You know the thing is, these are the players who are part of our squad right now. You may see them in the nets, you may see them in the practice games but nothing in the match. You need to give them opportunities and that&#39;s what counts.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>Noor Ahmad (Player of the Match):<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>&quot;I think it was a super win. Really happy with the win. Also, happy with my bowling. Brevis played really well and got us that win in the end. I didn&#39;t keep my focus on becoming the top wicket-taker. I just want to keep contributing to the team&#39;s win. I think the nick from Raghuvanshi &mdash; I enjoyed that wicket the most. I just try to use the length well and that&#39;s what&#39;s working for me right now.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n",

      "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>Match 56 of the TATA IPL 2025 promises a blockbuster clash as two top-performing sides&mdash;Mumbai Indians and Gujarat Titans&mdash;lock horns at the iconic Wankhede Stadium. Both teams have secured seven wins so far and are separated only by Net Run Rate, making this a virtual shootout for a top-two spot on the table.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\n<strong>Gujarat Titans have been the model of consistency this season, maintaining a settled top order that has delivered game after game. The trio of Sai Sudharsan, Shubman Gill, and Jos Buttler has formed the most successful top order of the tournament, collectively scoring 1,439 runs at an average of over 57 and a strike rate above 161. Remarkably, Gujarat remains the only team to have used the same three batters at the top in every game, underlining their clarity and cohesion. On the bowling front, Prasidh Krishna has been exceptional, leading the wicket charts with 19 scalps and proudly wearing the purple cap.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\n<strong>Mumbai Indians, after a shaky start, have bounced back in dominant fashion with six straight wins. Their revival has been led by the sensational form of Suryakumar Yadav, who has amassed 475 runs at an average of over 67 and a strike rate exceeding 172. What&rsquo;s more impressive is his consistency&mdash;he has crossed the 25-run mark in every match he has played this season. Supporting him with the ball is Trent Boult, who has claimed 16 wickets and been lethal with the new ball.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\n<strong>With both sides in red-hot form and playoffs in sight, this clash could go a long way in shaping the final standings. The momentum-driven Mumbai face the ever-consistent Gujarat, and with stars on both sides, it promises to be a thrilling contest at the Wankhede.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (33)_1746467596.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\nIPL Stats at Wankhede Stadium in 2025:<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 - 2025-05-06T183408_1746536854.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\nPitch Report- Ian Bishop and Matthew Hayden<\/strong><br \/>\nThis is a high-level clash here at the Wankhede Stadium. We are standing on pitch number 8. It&#39;s very very humid. Talking about the dimensions, it&#39;s 66 meters to the right, 5 meters shorter to the left, and 74 meters down the ground. There have been three games already on this surface. There has been a bit of weather around over the past few days, but today it&rsquo;s been quite hot and sunny. RCB posted a big total when they played here, while CSK couldn&rsquo;t post much. This wicket looks like a 200-plus surface. There may be a few showers tonight, so teams will probably look to chase. We also need to see whether there is any dew formation because both sides are high-powered batting units. For the bowlers, they&#39;ll need to be sharp and hope to come into the game early.<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (52)_1746538062.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>Toss Update<\/strong>: <strong><span style=\"color:#2c3e50\">GT won the toss and elected to field first!&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

With this clutch win, GT climbed to the top of the points table, showcasing nerves of steel under pressure.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Mumbai Indians, asked to bat first, managed 155\/8 in their 20 overs. Will Jacks top-scored with a fluent 53 off 35 balls, supported by Suryakumar Yadav&rsquo;s 35 off 24. But frequent wickets stalled their momentum&mdash;Rohit Sharma scored just 7, and captain Hardik Pandya made only 1. Corbin Bosch&rsquo;s late 27 gave MI a slight push. Gujarat&rsquo;s bowling was disciplined, with Sai Kishore (2\/34), Rashid Khan (1\/21), and Prasidh Krishna (1\/37) doing the damage.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Chasing the target, Gujarat lost Sai Sudharsan early for 5. Jos Buttler added 30, while skipper Shubman Gill anchored the innings with 43 off 46 balls. The chase was disrupted by rain multiple times, and after 18 overs were completed, the target was revised via the DLS method to 147 off 19 overs.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Needing 15 runs off the final over, Deepak Chahar began well, but a no-ball on the fourth delivery changed the momentum. Rahul Tewatia kept calm, scoring a crucial unbeaten 11 off 8 balls. He, alongside Arshad Khan, guided GT home off the very last ball of the match.<\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>Hardik Pandya (Mumbai Indians Captain):<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;Yes, definitely it&#39;s a tough way to go down. I think we fought really well with the total we had on the board. Most of the time we were out of the game but as a group, we kept pushing. It was a game of fine margins. It was definitely not a 150 wicket. We were short by 20-25 runs, maybe even 30 if we had batted better. Credit to the bowlers, they bowled in the right areas and kept fighting. I won&rsquo;t say catches cost us the game; we were clinical in the field. I&rsquo;d rather say the no-balls&mdash;my no-balls and even the last one. In my eyes, in T20s, it&#39;s a crime. It definitely hurt us today. Still, I&rsquo;m really happy that everyone gave their 120% and fought hard. In the first half of the second innings, the ground wasn&rsquo;t that wet, but later the ball kept getting wetter. The rain didn&rsquo;t help&mdash;it&rsquo;s not ideal to have so many stoppages. But at the end, we had to play, and we did.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Shubman Gill (Gujarat Titans Captain &amp; Player of the Match):<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#2c3e50\"><strong>&quot;Definitely. There was a bit of chaos when we came out to bat after the break, but it&#39;s great to get the win. The game plan changed during the powerplay with the rain&mdash;honestly, it felt like a Test match at times. We decided to play normal cricket, but with the interruptions, it wasn&rsquo;t easy to maintain rhythm.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2c3e50\"><strong>The wicket was a bit slow, so hitting through the line wasn&rsquo;t straightforward. It was challenging overall. There were a lot of emotions&mdash;mostly frustration&mdash;because we were ahead at one stage, but then we lost four wickets quickly. Again, it felt more like a Test match out there.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2c3e50\"><strong>In games like this, where you&#39;re chasing 150 and it goes down to the last ball, every contribution matters. Small things in the field really count. These tight wins push you forward in a tournament like the IPL.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2c3e50\"><strong>It&#39;s not easy for Rashid to return from injury, but he&#39;s putting in the hard work. His performance today was a really good sign. As a team, we&rsquo;re taking it one game at a time. We&#39;re not thinking about standings or top-four just yet&mdash;we&#39;re focused on building into a strong unit for the long run.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n",

      "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>Match 55 of the TATA IPL 2025 brings a high-stakes battle as Sunrisers Hyderabad take on Delhi Capitals in what could be a defining clash for both teams&#39; playoff aspirations. The stakes are higher for Hyderabad, who not only need to win this match but also must triumph in their remaining fixtures and hope for favorable outcomes in other matches to keep their slim hopes alive. For Delhi, the equation is simpler&mdash;win, and their playoff chances receive a major boost.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Sunrisers Hyderabad have had a tough run this season, with only three wins to show from ten games. Two of those victories came at home, offering a glimmer of confidence as they return to familiar territory. However, their inconsistency and recent loss to Gujarat Titans have left them languishing in ninth place. Players like Heinrich Klaasen and Abhishek Sharma have shown flashes of brilliance but haven&rsquo;t been enough to turn the season around.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Delhi Capitals, currently fifth on the table with six wins, are in a precarious yet stronger position. They started the season with four wins in their first four games but have since lost four out of their last six, including a recent defeat that has put pressure back on them. Led by Axar Patel, and with experienced players like Faf du Plessis and Kuldeep Yadav in the ranks, DC have the firepower to dominate.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>With both sides entering off defeats and everything to play for, this contest promises to be a high-voltage thriller.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (32)_1746449098.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\nIPL Stats at Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in 2025:<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 - 2025-05-05T181225_1746449194.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/>&nbsp;<\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report &ndash; WV Raman &amp; Shane Watson:<\/strong><br \/>\n&quot;The longest boundary is straight down the ground at 76 meters, with square boundaries of 66 meters on either side. It&#39;s a red soil surface, so expect a bit of pace and bounce, and maybe some turn too.There&#39;s no grass on this pitch&mdash;it&#39;s dry but hard, which means the ball should carry through well. In the last game here, SRH scored 190 but LSG chased it down inside 16 overs. That tells you it&rsquo;s a good wicket for batting.It might not assist the spinners too much, but the ball will come onto the bat nicely. The average first-innings score here has been over 200. So, expect plenty of runs again.Interestingly, SRH have won just 2 of their 5 matches at this venue in Hyderabad.&quot;<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (24)_1746452349.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS UPDATE:<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/SRH-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" \/><span style=\"color:#d35400\">Won The Toss And Elected To Field<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

      "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Hello and welcome to Match 54 of the TATA IPL 2025, coming to you from the breathtaking heights of Dharamsala&mdash;hosting its first clash of the season! It&rsquo;s the Punjab Kings&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/PK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:54px\" title=\"\" \/> taking on the Lucknow Super Giants&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/LSG-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" \/> in a very important game for both playoff hopefuls. Punjab enter the contest with their tails up after pulling off a stunning run chase in Chennai, while Lucknow find themselves in must-win territory, having stumbled in three of their last four games. With the mountain air charged with anticipation, will the Kings keep climbing, or can the Super Giants halt the slide and rise again? Grab your popcorn, this one&rsquo;s a pressure cooker!<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (31)_1746367689.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>VENUE STATS:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Teams have opted to chase in all the 4 matches played at this ground since 2023, but the teams batting first have won 3 of those games. The average 1st innings score here since 2023 is 201, with the last game played here in IPL 2024 saw RCB post a mammoth 241 on board.<\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\n<strong>PITCH REPORT | Aaron Finch:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&quot;We&rsquo;ve got 62 meters on one side and 68 meters on the other &mdash; definitely not a big ground. The average total in evening matches here is over 200, so expect a high-scoring contest. The pitch has been under covers for a couple of days and shows some variation in colour, with patches that look noticeably abrasive. And with cloud cover around, dew is unlikely to be a major factor. That means bowlers &mdash; especially the spinners &mdash; will have just enough assistance to stay in the game.&quot;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rishabh Pant has called it right at the toss and Lucknow will field first!<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

After being put into bat first, PBKS posted a formidable total of 236 for 5 in their allotted 20 overs. Prabhsimran Singh led the charge with a scintillating 91 off 48 balls, including six fours and seven sixes. Captain Shreyas Iyer contributed a brisk 45, while Josh Inglis and Shashank Singh added valuable runs to bolster the innings. For LSG, Digvesh Singh Rathi was the standout bowler, claiming two wickets.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>In response, LSG&#39;s chase faltered early, with Arshdeep Singh dismantling the top order by removing Mitchell Marsh, Aiden Markram, and Nicholas Pooran in quick succession. Despite a resilient 74 off 40 balls from Ayush Badoni and a rapid 45 from Abdul Samad, LSG managed 199 for 7, falling short of the target. Azmatullah Omarzai and Yuzvendra Chahal also made significant contributions with the ball, each taking crucial wickets.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>This victory propels PBKS to second place on the points table, enhancing their playoff prospects, while LSG faces increased pressure to secure wins in their remaining matches to stay in contention.<\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Rishabh Pant (Lucknow Super Giants Captain):<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;Conceding that many runs really hurt us. Dropping crucial catches at key moments cost us badly.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>We expected more assistance from the surface, but we didn&rsquo;t read the lengths early on, and that set us back. That&rsquo;s how the game goes sometimes.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>The dream is still alive. If we can win our next three games, we can turn things around.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>When the top order is in form, it makes sense they get more time. But we can&rsquo;t expect them to do all the heavy lifting every time. We must learn to take the game deep as a unit.<\/strong><\/span>&quot;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Shreyas Iyer (Punjab Kings Captain):<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;We&#39;re elated. Everyone stepped up at the right time and contributed brilliantly. Prabh&rsquo;s performance today was outstanding&mdash;every shot he played was a delight to watch.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Honestly, I&rsquo;m glad I wasn&rsquo;t aware of the records or milestones&mdash;I just focused on winning the match, and I&rsquo;m proud we got the job done. We&#39;ve had a bit of luck, but that luck has come from the hard work being put in behind the scenes.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Yes, the execution from everyone today was top-notch. The only area where we still need to improve is fielding awareness and movement&mdash;we need to tighten up there.&nbsp;Going forward, it&rsquo;s all about backing ourselves and playing with a positive mindset. For us, the result that matters is winning.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Prabhsimran Singh (Player of the Match):<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;Thank you, sir&mdash;appreciate it.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>This was a special knock for me, but more importantly, those two points mean a lot to the team. I&rsquo;m glad I could contribute in a winning cause. After the dropped catch, I was already in and had scored 20&ndash;25 runs. I knew I had to capitalise on that chance and make it count. We took our time to assess the pitch, and once we understood it, we knew a score above 200 was par. We&rsquo;re all playing according to the demands of the situation. If you look at our batting unit, everyone adjusts accordingly. And thankfully, in each game, one or two of us steps up to deliver.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n",

It&#39;s the Kolkata Knight Riders&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/KKR-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" \/> locking horns with the Rajasthan Royals&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" \/> in what could be a playoff-defining contest. KKR, the reigning champions, are riding high after a commanding win over Delhi and are back in their fortress for a crucial two-game stretch that could cement their top-four status. Meanwhile, the Royals&mdash;officially out of playoff contention&mdash;have nothing to lose and everything to spoil. Will Rajasthan play party poopers, or will Kolkata rise once again in front of their roaring home crowd? Strap in, it&#39;s going to be an evening of fire and fight!<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (30)_1746352080.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>VENUE STATS:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The teams winning the toss have opted to field in 10 of the 12 games played at this venue since 2024, and the pacers have picked up 65% of the wickets. Previously this season, Lucknow had pipped Kolkata by 4 runs in the afternoon game played here, where over 450 runs were scored in the game. Will we see another high-scoring thriller today?<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT | Deep Das Gupta &amp; Eoin Morgan:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The dimensions, 66 meters on one side, 60 on the other, and 74 down the ground. Visually, you notice dry patches despite a grass covering most of it is dead. The big challenge for the ground staff would&rsquo;ve been retaining moisture. Though it looks dry and dark, the surface is still holding together well. Unlike those classic &lsquo;jigsaw puzzle&rsquo; Eden tracks that break up, this one seems solid. Might slow a bit early on and aid spinners, but overall a good batting wicket. Since sunsets are early here, chasing would be the preferred option as batting could get easier in the second innings.&rdquo;<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (51)_1746352779.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Ajinkya Rahane wins the toss and Kolkata will bat <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp;first!&nbsp;<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

Angkrish Raghuvanshi impressed again with a fluent 44, while skipper Ajinkya Rahane anchored with a composed 30.<\/p>\n\n<p>In reply in the chase, RR lost early wickets, slumping to 71\/5 inside 8 overs, credit to the KKR spinners &mdash;&nbsp;Varun Chakravarthy (2\/32) and Moeen Ali (2\/43). But Riyan Parag, playing a captain&rsquo;s knock, lit up Eden with a sensational 95 off 45 balls, smacking 6 fours and 8 sixes and&nbsp;despite a spirited effort from Shubham Dubey in the end KKR held their nerve to seal a nail-biting victory to&nbsp;boost their position on the table.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff00ff\"><strong>Riyan Parag, Rajasthan Royals Skipper:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span>&quot;I had planned to stay until the final two overs, but unfortunately, I got out in the 18th. Looking back, we could have explored better bowling options in the last six overs. There&#39;s no one to blame but ourselves; we should have closed the game.&nbsp;We weren&rsquo;t clinical enough on the field, and we&rsquo;re facing the consequences now.&quot;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Ajinkya Rahane, Kolkata Knight Riders Skipper:<\/strong><\/span>&nbsp;&quot;It was a really close game, but I&rsquo;m very happy. Winning by just one or two runs gives you a special kind of satisfaction. Gurbaz and Angkrish batted brilliantly, and that finishing touch from Russell was outstanding. The plan was to go hard in the powerplay and then stabilise the innings until around the 12th over. It&rsquo;s never easy for a new batter coming in, so Angkrish and I kept communicating to take it deep. Fielding plays a huge role&mdash;saving 10 to 12 runs can make a big difference. A couple of good catches or a run-out can completely change the game.&quot;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Andre Russell is the Player of the Match<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Andre Russell:<\/strong><\/span>&nbsp;&quot;We all knew how important this game was. With four matches left, it felt like we were playing four finals. I&#39;m really happy with our performance and getting the win tonight. I wasn&rsquo;t too concerned about the dot balls early on because I knew I had time. It was a tough wicket to walk in and start hitting from ball one, but I&rsquo;m glad I was able to find some boundaries at the end. You have to assess the situation, know which bowlers to see off and which ones to target. When I look at the last five overs, I see 30 balls. If I can face 15 of those, I believe I can get 40 runs with the power I have.&quot;<\/p>\n",

Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bengaluru. RCB, currently third on the points table with 14 points from 10 matches, aim to secure a top-two finish and solidify their playoff position. In contrast, CSK, already eliminated from playoff contention, seek to play the role of spoilers and restore some pride in the closing stages of their campaign.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>RCB enters the match in formidable form, having won their last three games. Virat Kohli has been instrumental, amassing over 400 runs this season, including five half-centuries. The bowling unit, led by Josh Hazlewood and Bhuvneshwar Kumar, has been effective, particularly in the powerplay overs. Krunal Pandya&#39;s contributions with both bat and ball have further strengthened the team&#39;s performance.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>CSK, on the other hand, have endured a challenging season with eight losses in ten matches. Despite the team&#39;s struggles, young talents like Dewald Brevis and Ayush Mhatre have shown promise. Veteran MS Dhoni, who averages 81.5 with a strike rate of 181.11 at the Chinnaswamy Stadium, remains a key figure in the lineup.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The pitch at Chinnaswamy has been more balanced this season, offering assistance to both batsmen and bowlers. Spinners have found success in the middle overs, and dew is expected to play a role in the second innings, potentially favouring the chasing team. Weather forecasts indicate a possibility of light rain, which could lead to brief interruptions.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Historically, CSK leads the head-to-head record with 21 wins out of 34 matches. However, RCB has won the last two encounters, including a 50-run victory earlier this season. With RCB&#39;s current momentum and CSK&#39;s desire to end on a high note, this match promises to be a compelling contest.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (29)_1746278345.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\nIPL 2025 Stats At Chinnaswamy Stadium:<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 - 2025-05-03T185611_1746279792.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>Pitch Report | Ian Bishop &amp; Shane Watson:<\/strong><br \/>\n&quot;It&#39;s always an absolute pleasure being here at this iconic venue for another match in the TATA IPL. The thing that I&#39;m pleased about is the weather&mdash;we&#39;ve got clear skies, which is a good sign after a lot of rain over the past couple of days in Bengaluru. We&#39;re standing on pitch number seven, which is right in the center of the square, so the dimensions are equidistant&mdash;64 meters both to the right and left, and 73 meters straight down the ground. This surface, pitch number seven, has produced varying scores&mdash;one match with 160, another close to 200.It&#39;s more of a prediction, But this pitch looks really nice&mdash;no doubt about that. The standout for me is that it&rsquo;s a little drier than what we&#39;ve seen so far in the tournament. There&#39;s not much grass cover on it. If you come down and take a close look, it&#39;s very platy and dry, and you won&rsquo;t see that tennis ball bounce that&rsquo;s been common here. That means the ball is going to come onto the bat a lot truer. Batters will be able to trust the bounce more, and I&rsquo;d be very surprised if the team batting first doesn&rsquo;t aim to set a high total.

The Caribbean all-rounder lit up the death overs, smashing four fours and six towering sixes.<br \/>\nCSK&#39;s chase was steered by a stunning counterattack from Ayush Mhatre, who slammed 94 off 48 balls, and Ravindra Jadeja, who remained unbeaten on 77 from 45. At 172\/2 in the 17th over, the match was CSK&rsquo;s to lose.But Lungi Ngidi&rsquo;s triple strike and Yash Dayal&rsquo;s clutch final over turned the game. With 15 needed off the last over, Dayal held his nerve yet again in a pressure finish against CSK.<\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>MS Dhoni | CSK Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#e67e22\"><strong>&quot;I think I should&rsquo;ve converted a couple more shots when I went in to bat&mdash;I&rsquo;ll take the blame for that. We pulled things back well in the middle overs after their good start, but Romario Shepherd was outstanding at the death.We need to work more on bowling yorkers. In high-pressure moments, yorkers or even low full tosses are tough to hit and should be our go-to. Pathirana has the pace but needs more consistency.Lap and ramp shots are useful in modern cricket, though not every batter is comfortable playing them. Jaddu can paddle but prefers hitting straight.Ayush Mhatre played a really good innings. The batting unit stepped up today, which was great to see, but the bowling wasn&#39;t quite up to the mark.&quot;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Rajat Patidar | RCB Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;It was a tight game, credit to their batters, but our bowlers showed great courage. Our death-over specialist delivered once again, just like last season.I backed Suyash despite it being a 50-50 call, and he came through.Lungi brings valuable experience with the white ball, and I had full faith in him. Watching those big sixes from the dugout was fun! We&#39;re not just thinking about qualification&mdash;we want to finish strong in these last 3 games. We&#39;ll celebrate a little now, but the big celebration is for after the tournament.&quot;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Romario Shepherd | Player Of The Match:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;Been waiting for this chance and glad I could finish strong for the team. My power comes from a strong base and clean swing&mdash;just focused on holding my shape. DK gave us specific drills and it paid off tonight.

With both sides eyeing contrasting outcomes, expect a high-pressure clash tonight.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Gujarat Titans enter the contest on the back of a heavy defeat to Rajasthan Royals, but remain well-placed in the top half of the points table. A win here would take them a step closer to securing a playoff berth. Their batting unit continues to be powered by the in-form trio of Sai Sudharsan, Shubman Gill, and Jos Buttler &mdash; a top order that has consistently laid the foundation for big totals. In the bowling department, the experience and accuracy of Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, and Rashid Khan lend GT a well-rounded edge.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>For Sunrisers Hyderabad, the stakes are higher. With just a handful of games left and a slim path to the playoffs, they must win every remaining fixture to stay alive in the tournament. Despite a patchy season, SRH&rsquo;s victories have been spectacular. Their 286-run total against RR is still the highest of this season, and their thrilling chase of 246 against PBKS remains the biggest successful chase in IPL 2025. Most recently, they broke their Chepauk curse by defeating CSK for the first time in Chennai &mdash; a massive morale booster coming into this clash after a week-long break.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>SRH&rsquo;s major challenge remains consistency &mdash; brilliance in one game has often been followed by a slump. GT, on the other hand, have been more stable across departments.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>With the race for the top four narrowing, this match could shape the fate of both teams. Will GT strengthen their grip on qualification, or will SRH deliver another headline performance to keep their dream alive?<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (38)_1746190710.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\nIPL Stats At Narendra Modi Stadium Since 2024:<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (19)_1746189515.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report by Nick Knight and Eoin Morgan:<\/strong><br \/>\n&quot;It&rsquo;s the second time this surface is being used&mdash;196 played 160 in the earlier match between GT and Mumbai Indians, with GT coming out on top. The pitch looks beautiful tonight. In their previous game against the Punjab Kings, GT were out-batted by the explosive power of the opposition and couldn&rsquo;t match their firepower. The shift to black soil suits GT&rsquo;s style of play; it&rsquo;s more aligned with their template. Tonight, there&rsquo;s a lovely grass covering and an interesting subplot&mdash;Pat Cummins captained Australia to a World Cup win on this very wicket, so he&rsquo;ll know how to adapt to the conditions.<\/p>\n\n<p>In terms of the game plan, it&rsquo;s all about slower balls into the wicket and introducing spin early. The idea is to be variable and take wickets at the top of the order. Both teams rely heavily on their top-order strength. The likes of Head, Sharma, Kishan, and Klaasen will be going up against Sai Sudharsan, Gill, Buttler, and Rutherford. Expect plenty of runs to rain down at Ahmedabad. The wicket has been docile, pliant, and batter-friendly. All kinds of shots have been played here, and the bowlers will have to keep up in a high-scoring battle where swords will rule the roost. We&rsquo;re in for a high-scoring game for sure.&quot;<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 - 2025-05-02T193337_1746194815.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\n<strong>Toss Update<\/strong>: <span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>SRH has won the toss and opted to field first!&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

The win lifts GT to second place in the standings, reinforcing their playoff credentials with both bat and ball.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Put into bat first, Gujarat&rsquo;s top order fired on all cylinders. Sai Sudharsan smashed a blazing 48 off 23 deliveries, setting the tempo early. Shubman Gill then took control with a captain&rsquo;s knock of 76 from just 38 balls, showing his class with effortless stroke play. Jos Buttler followed suit, hammering a 64 off 37 to power GT to an imposing 224\/6 &mdash; a total built on precision and power. Jaydev Unadkat was the pick of SRH&rsquo;s bowlers, bagging three wickets in the death overs.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Chasing 225, Sunrisers Hyderabad needed a flying start &mdash; and Abhishek Sharma nearly gave them one. The young left-hander was the lone bright spark in the SRH innings, smashing 74 off just 41 balls with 4 fours and 6 sixes. He attacked the spinners and kept the chase alive through the middle overs. However, lack of support from the other end hurt SRH&rsquo;s momentum. Once Abhishek fell in the 15th over, SRH&rsquo;s hopes faded.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Prasidh Krishna and Mohammed Siraj took two wickets apiece, while Gerald Coetzee and Ishant Sharma chipped in with crucial breakthroughs. Despite a late cameo from Pat Cummins, SRH could only muster 186\/6 in their 20 overs.<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Pat Cummins (Sunrisers Hyderabad Captain):<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>&quot;There were a couple of things that didn&rsquo;t go our way. Our powerplay with the bat wasn&rsquo;t great&mdash;I was as guilty as anyone there. We probably let them get 20&ndash;30 extra runs and maybe could&rsquo;ve held on to one or two catches&mdash;I&rsquo;m guilty there too. Chasing 200 would&rsquo;ve looked more realistic with better execution.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>They&rsquo;re class batters&mdash;nothing flashy, but if you bowl bad balls, they punish you, and we probably gave away too many. That said, going for just 140 in the last 14 overs was a good effort with the ball.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>Sharma batted nicely and Nitish finished well, but we left ourselves with a little too much to do, too late. We&rsquo;re still clinging on to some hope. With the big auction last year, the core of this group will be around for three years, so there&rsquo;s a lot to play for.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>This is an amazing venue&mdash;the crowd is loud and incredibly supportive, it&rsquo;s always a great place to play.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Shubman Gill (Gujarat Titans Captain):<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;Definitely didn&rsquo;t plan that&mdash;playing just 22 balls in a 20-over game wasn&rsquo;t the idea. The only conversation we had was to keep playing the kind of cricket we&rsquo;ve been playing so far. On a black soil pitch, hitting sixes isn&rsquo;t easy, but with the way Sai, Jos, and I play, we understand how to keep the scoreboard moving.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>We&rsquo;ve never really had that conversation about one of us needing to stay till the end&mdash;we&rsquo;re all just hungry for runs and focused on doing what&rsquo;s best for the team.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Fielding is something we talk about before every match. We&rsquo;ve been average in that department this season, so I&rsquo;m happy with how we fielded today. Everyone is chipping in, and it&rsquo;s great to have options when defending totals on these kinds of grounds.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>There was a small discussion between me and the umpire&mdash;sometimes, when you&rsquo;re giving your 110 percent, emotions can get involved, and that&rsquo;s just part of the game.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Prasidh Krishna (Player of the Match):<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;Honestly, wearing the Purple Cap doesn&rsquo;t feel any different. I&rsquo;m just happy we got this important victory&mdash;it was crucial for us. We had two long breaks, and after not winning the game post-break, this one meant a lot.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>I&rsquo;d say my control over length has been really good, and all the work we&rsquo;ve been putting in as a team, along with the support from everyone around, has made a big difference. I&rsquo;m really enjoying how the ball is coming out.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>My preparation starts with what I want to do personally, and then I think about how I&rsquo;d approach the specific batters I&rsquo;m going to face in the game. I&rsquo;ve got a lot of people around me who&rsquo;ve played a lot of cricket, and I often chat with them, focus on hitting the right areas, and take it from there.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>I have a red ball in my room that I&rsquo;ve been playing around with, though I haven&rsquo;t taken it onto the field yet.

The Jaipur crowd will be buzzing to see their local boy again, as Rajasthan aim to stack up wins and stay in the playoff hunt.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>On the other side, Mumbai Indians are a freight train at full speed&mdash;five wins on the bounce and chasing their sixth like a side possessed. History suggests good things happen when MI gets on a streak like this&mdash;finals have followed every five-win run, bar the inaugural season. With Rohit Sharma rediscovering his mojo, Suryakumar Yadav delivering runs for fun, and Bumrah-Boult breathing fire with the ball, this team looks near-perfect. But tonight, they meet a Royals outfit brimming with belief and backed by their home crowd.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>One team is chasing history, and the other is writing new headlines.

Teams winning the toss have opted to field first in 5 of the 8 occasions and the teams chasing have come out on top on 5 of the 8 occasions as well. The pacers have dominated with 59% of the wickets at the venue in the last 2 IPL, with 41% of the wickets taken by spinners<\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\n<strong>PITCH REPORT | Ian Bishop &amp; Matthew Hayden:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s a hot evening, around 38&ndash;39&deg;C, and I&rsquo;m standing on pitch number 5. The square boundaries are 60 meters to the left, 57 to the right, and 69 meters straight down the ground. Unlike the previous game, there&#39;s less breeze today and a slightly reduced grass covering. However, the cracks on this surface are holding firm&mdash;it&rsquo;s still a very good batting wicket.

The Paltans continued their domination inside the Powerplay, dismissing half of the Rajasthan side within the Powerplay. Bumrah and Karn Sharma further dismantled the Rajasthan batting lineup, bundling out the Royals for 117.&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Mumbai Indians get their sixth win on the trot and move to the top of the table now, and the five-time champs are peaking at the right time.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff00ff\"><strong>Riyan Parag, Rajasthan Royals Skipper:<\/strong><\/span>&nbsp;&quot;We have to give credit to the way Mumbai played. As far as our batting is concerned, it wasn&#39;t our day. 190-200 would have been ideal to chase, but then Hardik and Surya bhai at the end switched it up, we could have done a few things better, but it is how it is. We have been getting good starts, but it is up to the middle order to step up when we lose wickets in the powerplay. We have done a lot of things right, a lot of things wrong, we want to focus on the things we have done right.&quot;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, Mumbai Indians Skipper:<\/strong><\/span>&nbsp;&quot;With the ball, we were spot on. Talking with SKY, we focused on playing percentage and proper cricket shots. Ro and Ryan did the same, kept the intent, targeted the gaps, and it was fantastic to watch. It&rsquo;s not about giving chances, it&rsquo;s about doing what the situation demands. Our bowling unit is experienced and clear with their roles, so I don&rsquo;t have to worry much. We&rsquo;re keeping it simple, staying humble and disciplined, and just focusing on playing good, effective cricket.&quot;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Ryan Rickelton is the Player of the Match<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Ryan Rickelton:<\/strong><\/span> &quot;It&rsquo;s really special to perform in front of my family, they&rsquo;re here this week, and it means a lot. Always happy to contribute to Mumbai Indians, it&#39;s such a good group, and we&rsquo;re finding momentum at the right time. Batting with Rohit was incredible. We had a slow start to the tournament, but things are clicking now. The weather made us a bit unsure in the first few overs, but we settled in well and laid a solid foundation before watching Hardik and SKY take over. Adjusting to Indian conditions has been the biggest challenge. Early on, I tried changing too much, but now I&rsquo;m sticking to the basics that brought me success, with a few tweaks.&quot;<\/p>\n",

Delhi cling to playoff hopes, KKR fight to survive &mdash; it&rsquo;s not just a match, it&rsquo;s redemption on the line! The Delhi pitch plays tricks &mdash; batters feast early, but as the night deepens, spinners spin webs. KL Rahul, Delhi&rsquo;s anchor with 364 runs, faces Varun Chakaravarthy&rsquo;s bag of tricks. Axar Patel marshals the spin and middle order, while Mitchell Starc seeks a fiery redemption spell after a few tough outings. For KKR, Ajinkya Rahane&rsquo;s classical elegance must make way for fireworks; Sunil Narine could be pushed up to trigger chaos. Dre Russ lurks, the game-changer KKR desperately need. Nostalgia sweeps through with Rishabh Pant watching from the dugout. It&rsquo;s a battle of spin vs pace too &mdash; Kuldeep&rsquo;s guile against Harshit Rana&rsquo;s raw speed. History? KKR lead overall, but Delhi&rsquo;s recent edge and home turf advantage tilt the scales. Still, T20 is a cruel game &mdash; one Russell blitz or a Narine special and the script flips!

It&#39;s not too hot and it&#39;s not too cool. We are standing on Pitch Number 5 for this game&mdash;the same surface where that Super Over was played with 188 playing 188. Talking about the dimensions, it&rsquo;s 63 meters to my right, 62 meters to my left, and 67 meters straight down the ground.As far as the outfield is concerned, the grass is very well cut, but more importantly, we want to understand this 22-yards.&nbsp;This pitch looks a bit more compact and has a bit of sheen on it, suggesting it will hold together a little more. I think this surface won&#39;t heavily bring spinners like Narine and Chakaravarthy into play. We shouldn&rsquo;t be far off the score we saw against Rajasthan Royals. It&#39;s not a belter by any means, but when you compare it to the surface that was used against RCB and MI, this one looks significantly better.&quot;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (50)_1745933971.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE: <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/DC-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Won The Toss And Elected To Field<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

In a match that swung like a pendulum, Kolkata Knight Riders held their nerve to clinch a 14-run win over Delhi Capitals, defending 205 with grit, guile, and some magic from their senior pros.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Put into bat, KKR&rsquo;s top order lit up the evening &ndash; Gurbaz&rsquo;s electric 26 off 12, Narine&rsquo;s fearless 27, and a composed 44 from young Angkrish Raghuvanshi laid the platform. Later, Rinku (36) and Russell&rsquo;s cameo pushed KKR to a formidable 204\/9, despite Starc&rsquo;s triple strike and Axar&rsquo;s control (4-0-27-2).<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>DC began their chase in a flash but soon stumbled. Faf du Plessis fought a lone battle, scoring a fine 62 off 45, and skipper Axar Patel smashed 43 off 23 to keep hopes alive. But Sunil Narine&rsquo;s clutch spell (3\/29) turned the game on its head.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vipraj Nigam&rsquo;s 38 off 19 injected late drama, but DC fell short at 190\/9.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>A crucial win for KKR, and Narine, leading in Rahane&rsquo;s absence in the last stages of the match, proved why he&rsquo;s one of IPL&rsquo;s smartest minds.

While chasing, our calculations weren&rsquo;t up to the mark, and I believe the match turned on its head with two to three soft dismissals.That said, I&rsquo;m pleased with how we fought back after a poor start with the ball. We managed to restrict them to a chaseable total, which was a positive takeaway. In the second innings, a couple of batters didn&rsquo;t contribute much, but the others stepped up and covered that gap. We were just a couple of big hits away from securing those two points. We&rsquo;ve lost a few close games this season, and in such situations, it&rsquo;s important to stay calm when you&#39;re out there in the middle.When Vipraj was scoring, we still had hope. I felt that if Ashu had supported him at the other end, it could&rsquo;ve reminded us of our comeback in the first game against LSG. But that&rsquo;s how the game goes. Still, full credit to Vipraj&mdash;he bowled really well and played a solid knock.As for my injury, when I tried stopping the ball, my hand dragged on the surface and I scraped the skin. So whenever the bat brushed against that area, it was painful. The good part is we now have a 3&ndash;4 day break before our next match against SRH, and hopefully I&rsquo;ll be fully recovered by then.&quot;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Ajinkya Rahane | KKR Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>&quot;I think I&rsquo;ll be okay&mdash;nothing too serious. After the 13th over, when Sunil bowled those two crucial overs and picked up a couple of wickets, the game really swung in our favour. They lost quick wickets, and that was the turning point.We felt that 204 was a good total on that wicket, but in hindsight, we were probably 15 runs short. Still, as a batting unit, we were going well. And as a fielding unit, when the opposition is chasing 205, you&rsquo;re always just one or two wickets away from getting control.Sunil bowled brilliantly, and that one over from Russell, plus Anukul Roy&rsquo;s contribution, were all important. We went with Anukul because historically, left-arm spinners have done well here, so we backed that call.As I mentioned at the toss, it&rsquo;s one game at a time for us&mdash;we don&rsquo;t want to think too far ahead. That&rsquo;s always been the messaging. What&rsquo;s in the past is in the past; we want to take confidence from this win and move forward.&quot;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Sunil Narine | Player of the Match:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>&quot;It was a total team effort. The way we started with Gurbaz, and then Angki [Raghuvanshi] and Rinku carried it forward, was excellent. I still back myself to come in and deliver for the team. Some games you start well and fade later, and in some, you begin slow but finish strong. I enjoyed all the wickets&mdash;each one is crucial, and the more you get, the better it is for the team.About that direct hit&mdash;I&#39;m not the greatest fielder, but it was good to get a run-out. Just pick up and throw the ball as hard as you can!What keeps me going is self-pride. I always want to give the captain the option of using me in any situation. If you want to be that kind of player, you&rsquo;ve got to keep up the hard work, even when there&rsquo;s no training.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n",

      "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong><span style=\"color:#000000\">The Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur braces for a high-stakes clash tonight as Rajasthan Royals (RR) lock horns with Gujarat Titans (GT) in Match 47 of TATA IPL 2025. Scheduled for a 7:30 PM start, the encounter could prove decisive for the playoff race.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#000000\">Rajasthan Royals, under stand-in captain Riyan Parag, are grappling with form, having registered just two wins from nine matches. Despite Yashasvi Jaiswal&rsquo;s promising performances with the bat, the side has struggled for collective consistency. The bowling unit too has lacked the edge needed to defend totals or apply pressure up front. With the playoffs slipping out of reach, RR must find inspiration quickly to keep their campaign alive.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#000000\">In contrast, Gujarat Titans continue their impressive march. Led by the calm and composed Shubman Gill, GT have secured six wins in eight matches. Jos Buttler has given them flying starts, while Sai Sudharsan has been prolific in anchoring the innings, ensuring stability through the middle overs. With Prasidh Krishna and Mohammed Siraj leading the charge with the ball, Gujarat look like a well-rounded, confident unit.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#000000\">Historically, GT have dominated this fixture, winning six of their seven meetings with Rajasthan. Jaipur&rsquo;s pitch is expected to favor batsmen early but could offer turn as the match progresses, bringing spinners into play.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#000000\">With Gujarat aiming to consolidate their top-two standing and Rajasthan desperate for survival, expect a gripping contest tonight under the lights.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (36)_1745844501.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\nIPL Stats At Sawai Mansingh Stadium since 2024:<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (18)_1745846712.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Pitch Report &ndash; Daren Ganga &amp; Matthew Hayden<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;It&#39;s the third match of the season here at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium. Conditions are relatively hot with a gentle breeze blowing across the ground. We are playing on pitch number 6 today. In terms of dimensions, it&#39;s 63 meters to one square boundary, 67 meters to the other, and 71 meters straight down the ground. In the two matches this season, the average first-innings score has been 177. Since 2024, we haven&#39;t seen a 200+ total at this venue.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Looking closely at the pitch, there&#39;s a perfect grass covering. The surface is hard, with a few minor cracks just starting to appear. It suggests that this may not be a 200-plus wicket, but a 180-plus score would put a team in the game. The presence of live grass means the ball should skid on nicely, and we don&#39;t expect much sideways movement for the spinners either. Given the dimensions and the pitch behaviour, power hitters will be eyeing those boundaries. Overall, a score around 180 or more would be highly competitive today.&quot;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (49)_1745847901.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#000000\">Toss Update<\/span>: <span style=\"color:#ff00ff\">RR won the toss and elected to field first!&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

Shubman Gill played a captain&rsquo;s knock, smashing 84 off 50 balls, while Jos Buttler added an explosive unbeaten 50 off 26 deliveries. Sai Sudharsan contributed a quick 39 at the top. Despite the strong platform, Rajasthan&rsquo;s bowlers, particularly Maheesh Theekshana and Sandeep Sharma, managed to restrict Gujarat in the closing stages.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Chasing 210, Rajasthan Royals showcased fearless batting. Yashasvi Jaiswal anchored the innings brilliantly with an unbeaten 70 off 40 balls. However, the night truly belonged to the young Vaibhav Suryavanshi. The youngster played an astonishing knock, hammering 101 off just 38 balls &mdash; registering the second-fastest century in IPL history. His innings, filled with 11 boundaries and 7 sixes, decimated the Gujarat bowling attack and turned the chase into a one-sided affair.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Captain Riyan Parag added the finishing touches with an aggressive 32* off 15 balls, guiding Rajasthan to 212\/2 in just 15.5 overs.<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/m47final_1745863209.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Shubman Gill (Gujarat Titans Captain):<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;They took the game away from us in the powerplay and credit to them for that.

Some chances came early our way that we couldn&rsquo;t grab, and in hindsight, there are definitely areas we need to work on as a group.<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>As for sitting out in the second innings, I felt a bit of a back spasm, and with another game just a couple of days away, the physio didn&rsquo;t want to take a chance.

Our next match is at Ahmedabad, where we&rsquo;ve had a good run, and hopefully we can continue that.<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Speaking about Vaibhav Suryavanshi, it was truly his day. His hitting was tremendous, and he made full use of the opportunity he had.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Riyan Parag (Rajasthan Royals Captain):<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#ff00ff\"><strong>&quot;It was incredible. We have spent two months with him and coming out here in front of all these people and against the quality bowling attack that GT had, it&#39;s just something you can&rsquo;t express in words.<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#ff00ff\"><strong>We changed things a bit since the last game. We just thought of finishing off games a little earlier. We wanted to show more intent in the middle overs. Whenever a new batter walks in, can the other batter play some shots and back him? We wanted to try these things and it worked brilliantly tonight for us.<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#ff00ff\"><strong>You can learn almost every day watching the IPL. You can see how RCB runs in the field, you can watch how Surya bhaiya finishes games for MI. I think you just need to take notes from everyone and then try to execute the same when you get the chance.<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#ff00ff\"><strong>This win will be a big boost for us. We badly needed to win in a comprehensive style. It was a one-sided win, which makes me a little more happy. Now we need to take it one game at a time. We&rsquo;ll wait and see what kind of wicket we get here for the next game and take it from there.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>Vaibhav Suryavanshi (Player of the Match):<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#ff00ff\"><strong>&quot;I am feeling very good. Scoring my first hundred in the IPL, and that too in just my third innings, feels special. All the practice that I have put in over the last four to five months has finally paid off.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#ff00ff\"><strong>I don&#39;t look at the bowlers too much on the ground; I just try to play every ball on its merit.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#ff00ff\"><strong>I love batting with him. He keeps talking positively and constantly encourages me to do well.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#ff00ff\"><strong>It feels like a dream to score a century in the IPL. Like I said, I have worked hard in the last few months, and it has all come together beautifully.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#ff00ff\"><strong>No, I don&#39;t fear anything. I don&rsquo;t think too much; I just want to stay focused on my game.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n",

      "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>Tonight, the Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi will witness a high-stakes IPL 2025 clash as Delhi Capitals (DC) take on Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB). Both teams are in the top three of the points table, making this encounter crucial for playoff positioning.DC, led by KL Rahul, have been consistent this season, boasting a balanced side with both experienced and young talents. Their bowling attack, featuring Mitchell Starc and Kuldeep Yadav, has been particularly effective on home turf.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>RCB, under the captaincy of Rajat Patidar, have shown resilience, with Virat Kohli and Devdutt Padikkal anchoring the batting lineup. Their pace attack, including Josh Hazlewood and Bhuvneshwar Kumar, will be key on Delhi&#39;s batting-friendly pitch.The head-to-head record favors RCB, with 19 wins out of 32 matches against DC. However, DC&#39;s recent form and home advantage could tilt the balance.Expect a high-scoring thriller, with both teams eager to secure a top-two finish. The team that handles the pressure better and executes their plans efficiently will likely emerge victorious.<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (35)_1745758902.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/>&nbsp;<\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report &ndash; Graeme Swann &amp; Aaron Finch&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&quot;Good news for bowlers&mdash;on one side, the boundary is <strong>66 meters<\/strong>.But there&rsquo;s some bad news too&mdash;the other side is only <strong>58 meters<\/strong>.It&rsquo;s a <strong>71-meter hit straight down the ground<\/strong>, with a <strong>big pocket of 75 meters<\/strong> toward deep midwicket.Whether these dimensions come into play depends largely on the pitch.Whenever you come to <strong>Delhi<\/strong>, you&rsquo;re never quite sure what you&rsquo;ll get.

There was <strong>4.1 degrees of turn<\/strong> here compared to <strong>1.7 degrees<\/strong> in the other match.For me, it&rsquo;s important to <strong>get your spinners into the game early<\/strong>.There&rsquo;s only a <strong>tiny tinge of grass<\/strong>, so there won&rsquo;t be much assistance for the fast bowlers even though it might look green at first glance.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s going to be a <strong>pretty good wicket for the spinners<\/strong>.If you&rsquo;re batting, you probably want to <strong>score your runs early against the new ball<\/strong>, before it starts turning.&quot;<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (23)_1745760400.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Venue Stats:<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (16)_1745760462.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE:<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/RCB-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" \/> have won the toss and have opted to field<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

I&rsquo;m glad I was able to fulfill that role today.When Virat is at the other end, things become easier.A lot of credit goes to him&mdash;he kept backing me, encouraging me to find the gaps and keep the scoreboard ticking.I have always tried to be economical&mdash;this is my 10th season now.This year, I&rsquo;ve worked a lot on my bowling&mdash;varying my pace, understanding batters&rsquo; strengths, and using that to stay one step ahead.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n",

      "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>This afternoon, the Wankhede Stadium sets the stage for a high-stakes IPL 2025 clash between Mumbai Indians (MI) and Lucknow Super Giants (LSG). Both teams are locked at 10 points from nine matches, making this encounter pivotal in the playoff race.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>MI, under Hardik Pandya&#39;s leadership, have turned their season around with four consecutive wins. The resurgence of Rohit Sharma and Suryakumar Yadav has bolstered their batting lineup, while the bowling attack, spearheaded by Jasprit Bumrah, has been formidable.LSG, captained by Rishabh Pant, have had a mixed season. Despite a strong head-to-head record against MI, winning six out of seven encounters, they face challenges with Pant&#39;s form and recent inconsistencies.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The Wankhede pitch is known for its batting-friendly nature, with short boundaries favouring big hitters. However, early in the match, pacers might find some assistance, making the toss crucial. Teams winning the toss might prefer to field first, considering the dew factor in the evening. With both teams vying for a spot in the top four, expect a thrilling contest. MI&#39;s current momentum and home advantage could give them the edge, but LSG&#39;s past dominance can&#39;t be overlooked.&nbsp;<\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (34)_1745746476.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\n<strong>Pitch Report &ndash; Ian Bishop &amp; Eoin Morgan |<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s <strong>hot and humid<\/strong> here at Wankhede&mdash;<strong>33 degrees Celsius<\/strong>, but it feels closer to <strong>38 or even 40 degrees<\/strong> under this afternoon sun.It&rsquo;s going to be a <strong>special day<\/strong>, with <strong>over 19,000 school kids<\/strong> filling the stands, creating a fantastic atmosphere.As for the pitch, we&rsquo;re standing on the <strong>center strip<\/strong>&mdash;it&rsquo;s <strong>63 meters either side<\/strong> and <strong>73 meters straight down the ground<\/strong>.In <strong>day games<\/strong> at Wankhede historically, it&rsquo;s been <strong>evenly split<\/strong>&mdash;<strong>four wins batting first, four wins chasing<\/strong>.Looking closely at the surface, there&rsquo;s a <strong>magnificent covering of grass<\/strong> on top.

Not overthinking. In tough times, it&rsquo;s easy for players to start questioning themselves, and we don&rsquo;t want that mindset creeping in.It&rsquo;s always a team game. Yes, one player can make a difference, but collective performance is crucial.It was great to see Mayank back from injury. First game back, and he&rsquo;s already starting to find his rhythm. Hopefully, he&rsquo;ll get even better and stronger moving forward.&quot;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>Hardik Pandya | Mumbai Indians Captain:<br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;Absolutely. Momentum is crucial, and the way we are carrying it forward, with everyone clicking together, is fantastic.The energy created by the kids in the crowd today was special. We wanted to perform for them as much as for ourselves.Everyone kept taking their chances. Even after losing a couple of wickets late, Bosch smacked a few sixes, Naman contributed, and before that, Surya played an unbelievable innings.Everyone is chipping in&mdash;whether it&#39;s Ryan, Bosch, Naman, Surya, or myself&mdash;and that&rsquo;s what good teams are built on.Whenever required, I&rsquo;m ready to bowl myself. But today, I felt it was the right time to bring Bosch in and let him do what he does best.This is a very tough competition. We&rsquo;re mindful of not getting carried away.As a group, we&rsquo;ll continue to focus on playing good cricket without worrying too much about what&rsquo;s coming next.&quot;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Will Jacks | Player of the Match:<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;I&#39;ll always see myself as a batter who bowls, but when I bowl well, it&rsquo;s a bonus for the team and for me.I work very hard on my bowling. I know I&rsquo;m considered a part-timer, but I believe I can do the job when needed and there&#39;s still room for improvement.We knew how important Pooran and Pant were at that stage.As an off-spinner against left-handers, you&rsquo;re always looking for an opportunity. Once I got Pooran, there was a sense of relief and we knew we had the game in control.I really enjoy bowling to left-handers&mdash;it brings more chances my way.I&rsquo;ve loved my time here. Everyone has been so welcoming and given me a lot of confidence.As a team, we are now hitting the right areas, but there&rsquo;s still more work to do, and we&rsquo;re excited for the upcoming games.Jasprit is an incredible bowler. I&rsquo;ve had the displeasure of facing him in the nets&mdash;and trust me, it&#39;s not enjoyable!I&rsquo;m just grateful he&rsquo;s in my team. He&rsquo;s incredibly skillful and amazing to watch.&quot;<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n",

Shreyas Iyer has been a rock at the top for PBKS, scoring 263 runs at an average of 43.8, peppered with 20 maximums, and providing the team much-needed stability and aggression.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>KKR, despite a mixed season, boast the best boundary percentage in the powerplay at 80.9%, showing they have the firepower to dominate early. Ajinkya Rahane has been a key figure, amassing 271 runs at an average of 38.7, playing the anchor&rsquo;s role effectively.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>History between these two sides has been nothing short of dramatic. PBKS chased down a record total of 262 against KKR last season, but in stark contrast, they also defended the lowest total ever &mdash; just 111 &mdash; against the same opposition. With both teams carrying that backdrop into this clash, another memorable encounter could be on the cards.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>With playoff dreams on the line and pride at stake, expect fireworks, intensity, and maybe even another chapter in their record-breaking rivalry at Eden Gardens tonight.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (27)_1745671506.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\nIPL Stats at Eden Gardens Since 2024:<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 - 2025-04-26T184136_1745673543.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/>&nbsp;<\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report &ndash; Graeme Swann &amp; Matthew Hayden | Eden Gardens<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&quot;We&rsquo;re here in the middle of <strong>Eden Gardens<\/strong>, my favorite ground in India by a mile!Talking about dimensions: from a bowler&rsquo;s point of view, they&rsquo;re <strong>not that big<\/strong>&mdash;<strong>62 meters to my right<\/strong>, <strong>64 meters to my left<\/strong>, and <strong>75 meters straight down the ground<\/strong>.The real challenge for bowlers is the <strong>small pockets<\/strong>&mdash;just <strong>57 and 56 meters<\/strong>&mdash;making it tough for spinners to defend boundaries.That said, this <strong>pitch looks very good<\/strong>. It&rsquo;s a <strong>beautiful evening<\/strong> here, but there&#39;s also a <strong>strong breeze<\/strong> blowing straight down the ground, which could make bowling even trickier.What&rsquo;s fascinating about this pitch is that <strong>there are quite a few bare patches<\/strong> despite a little grass cover. As a bowler, <strong>you&#39;d want to target those rough areas<\/strong> to get some purchase.From what we&#39;ve seen across matches here, this has been a <strong>very dry wicket<\/strong>.This is the <strong>third time this track is being used<\/strong>, and it&rsquo;s been not easy<strong>&nbsp;to score on<\/strong> each time.<strong>Spinners from both sides<\/strong> could wreak havoc today. One end looks particularly <strong>bare and rough<\/strong> compared to the other, making <strong>hard lengths tricky<\/strong> for batters.Bottom line: if you want to score runs, you&rsquo;ll have to <strong>cash in against the fast bowlers<\/strong>&mdash;because the <strong>spinners could really dominate<\/strong> tonight.&quot;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (21)_1745674292.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE:&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/PK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:54px\" title=\"\" \/> <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Won The Toss And Elected To Bat<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

      "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>The spotlight shifts to the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai as Chennai Super Kings (CSK) take on Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in Match 43 of the IPL 2025. Both teams are level on points with four each from eight matches and are separated only by net run rate. With the playoff race tightening, a loss here could severely dent either team&rsquo;s qualification hopes.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>CSK have endured a tough campaign, with their top-order woes reflected in a league-low powerplay average of just 45 runs. The bowling unit hasn&rsquo;t fared much better, especially at the death, where containment has been a constant struggle. Despite their overall form, CSK will draw confidence from their strong home record, having never lost to SRH at Chepauk.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>SRH, meanwhile, have fared slightly better in the early overs, averaging 56 in the powerplay. But their campaign has been undermined by patchy performances in the middle overs and a lack of control in the final phase with the ball. Players like Heinrich Klaasen have shown flashes of brilliance, but consistency remains elusive.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>The Chepauk pitch is known to aid spin and has produced moderate first-innings scores, typically in the 170s. Dew could play a role later in the evening, making chasing a preferred option for the team winning the toss.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>With both sides battling for survival, expect a gripping encounter where every over counts and every mistake could prove costly in this must-win clash.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (33)_1745584954.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\nIPL Stats at MA Chidambaram Stadium Since 2024:<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (13)_1745586314.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Pitch Report &ndash; Simon Doull &amp; Michael Clarke<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&quot;We&rsquo;ve got <strong>70 meters on one side<\/strong>, <strong>63 meters on the other<\/strong>, and <strong>74 meters straight down the ground<\/strong>&mdash;a fairly balanced layout, but the <strong>short square boundary<\/strong> could come into play for the batters.<br \/>\nThe surface looks <strong>quite dry<\/strong>&mdash;very similar to what we&rsquo;ve seen here in previous games.

Chasing 155 for victory, SRH reached the target with eight balls to spare, handing CSK yet another home defeat in a season full of struggles.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Earlier, CSK, put in to bat, never quite got the momentum they needed. Shaik Rasheed fell on the very first ball,. Ayush Mhatre showed some intent with a quick 30, and Dewald Brevis sparkled briefly with 42 off 25 balls, hitting four sixes. However, regular wickets, especially in the middle overs, prevented CSK from accelerating. Harshal Patel was the pick of the SRH bowlers, claiming 4\/28, while Pat Cummins and Jaydev Unadkat chipped in with two wickets each to bowl CSK out for 154 in 19.5 overs.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>In response, SRH lost Abhishek Sharma early, but Ishan Kishan anchored the chase with a composed 44. Contributions from Aniket Verma, Kamindu Mendis (32*), and Nitish Kumar Reddy (19*) ensured SRH stayed ahead of the required rate despite some hiccups. Noor Ahmad was the most successful bowler for CSK with two wickets, but the target proved too modest to defend.<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/M34_1745604236.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>MS Dhoni (Chennai Super Kings Captain)<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>&quot;I think the key issue was that we kept losing wickets at regular intervals.<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Also, the wicket played better in the first innings. Scoring only 155 wasn&rsquo;t justifiable. It wasn&rsquo;t turning much early on&mdash;after the 10th over it became slightly two-paced&mdash;but we still should have batted better.<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>In the second innings, our spinners bowled well, but we were already 15&ndash;20 runs short, which made a big difference.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>I thought Brevis batted well today. We need someone like him in the middle order&mdash;someone who can counter spin effectively.<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>The way we have struggled in the middle overs against spin, it&rsquo;s crucial we find ways to bat smartly, keep rotating strike, and find boundaries. That&rsquo;s an area where we need improvement.<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>In a tournament like this, if one or two players are off-form, you can work around it. But when a majority of players are not performing, it becomes very difficult.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>You try giving players extra chances, but if it doesn&rsquo;t work, you need to make changes. When four players are struggling at once, you have no choice but to make multiple changes.Going forward, it&rsquo;s about assessing conditions better and putting enough runs on the board.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Pat Cummins (Sunrisers Hyderabad Captain)<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;That was a great performance. A few things came together nicely tonight, and it was good to see the boys playing with freedom and a few smiles around. We were pretty clinical overall. A couple of guys at the top looked like they wanted to take the game on, which was exactly what we needed in these conditions. We pushed Klaasen up the order, and Nitish did a brilliant job finishing it off. Our record here hasn&rsquo;t been great historically, so it&rsquo;s nice to get a win. Still things we can improve on to be more clinical, but overall, really pleased with the result.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Harshal Patel (Player of the Match)<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;It&rsquo;s a very pleasing win. Over the past 3&ndash;4&ndash;5 games, we&rsquo;ve been trying to put it all together, but every time, one piece or another was missing. For everything to click when we need it the most, especially with all games now being must-wins, feels really satisfying. I figured out early that hitting a good length and keeping it at the stumps was key on this surface. It was tough for the batters to play horizontal bat shots, so I was trying to make them hit over square leg and mid-wicket. I wasn&rsquo;t aiming wide outside off&mdash;I just focused on bowling into the stumps, and thankfully, it came off tonight. For me, having family around really helps. It allows me to switch off from cricket and reminds me that cricket is not the be-all and end-all. That balance keeps me grounded.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n",

      "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>The 42nd fixture of TATA IPL 2025 brings Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) back to their fortress at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, where they face Rajasthan Royals (RR) in a crucial mid-season clash. RCB sits in fourth place with 10 points from eight matches and will be determined to break their home jinx, having lost all three games played at this venue so far.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Their campaign has been powered by Virat Kohli&rsquo;s consistent run at the top, scoring 322 runs in eight innings, while skipper Rajat Patidar has provided stability with 221 runs in seven outings. Josh Hazlewood led the attack effectively with the ball, bagging 12 wickets and offering control in key phases.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Rajasthan Royals, placed eighth on the table, are desperate for a turnaround after four consecutive defeats. Riyan Parag continues to lead the side in the absence of Sanju Samson, who remains sidelined due to injury. Yashasvi Jaiswal has been their shining light with 307 runs at a healthy strike rate of 139+, but the team has faltered in pressure moments, including a recent failure to chase nine runs in the final over. The Chinnaswamy surface, usually a paradise for batters, has offered unexpected help to spinners this season. With clear skies and the likelihood of dew later in the evening, chasing might be the preferred option.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>While RCB enter the contest with momentum and a more settled core, RR will be hoping to halt their slide and revive their playoff aspirations.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (32)_1745499515.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\nIPL Stats At M.

That&rsquo;s the challenge tonight&mdash;<strong>can they translate that form onto this surface?&nbsp;<\/strong>Let&rsquo;s talk dimensions first. We&rsquo;re bang in the <strong>center of the ground<\/strong>&mdash;it&rsquo;s <strong>73 meters straight<\/strong>, and <strong>64 meters square<\/strong> on either side. So, not a lot to choose from in terms of targeting short boundaries.This pitch looks <strong>noticeably drier<\/strong> than it did in the previous game against Punjab. I&rsquo;d say it will play a lot better tonight&mdash;perhaps with a bit more evenness to it.That said, <strong>the average first-innings score this season is just 166<\/strong>, which tells you there&rsquo;s still something in it for the bowlers&mdash;<strong>especially the quicks<\/strong>.Interestingly, across all venues this season, <strong>Chinnaswamy has been the most effective for seamers<\/strong>. It&rsquo;s been a little <strong>two-paced<\/strong> at times, with <strong>extra bounce<\/strong>, especially for taller bowlers like <strong>Hazlewood and Marco Jansen<\/strong>, who got good rewards here.However, looking at tonight&rsquo;s strip, there&rsquo;s <strong>not much tufty grass<\/strong> left, so I expect it to be <strong>a better surface for batting<\/strong>.Just for perspective&mdash;<strong>last season&rsquo;s average first-innings score here was 197<\/strong>, which is <strong>significantly higher<\/strong> than what we&rsquo;ve seen so far this year.&quot;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (47)_1745502195.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Toss Update: <\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>RR Won the toss and elected to field first!&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

Chinnaswamy Stadium, snapping their home losing streak and climbing further up the points table.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>After being put in to bat, RCB posted a commanding 205\/5 on the back of a solid platform laid by Virat Kohli and Devdutt Padikkal. Kohli played the anchor role to perfection, scoring 70 off 42 balls, while Padikkal provided the acceleration with a quickfire 50 off just 27 deliveries. Earlier, Phil Salt gave the innings early momentum with 26, and Jitesh Sharma&rsquo;s unbeaten 20 off 10 helped push the total past 200. The RR bowlers, despite occasional breakthroughs, were unable to contain the run flow, with Sandeep Sharma picking up two wickets and Hasaranga and Archer chipping in with one each.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>In response, RR explosively began their chase, thanks to Yashasvi Jaiswal&rsquo;s 49 off just 19 balls. Riyan Parag and Dhruv Jurel kept the momentum going in the middle overs, but RCB struck at regular intervals to prevent any one batter from taking the game away. Josh Hazlewood was the standout with the ball, finishing with 4\/33, including the key wickets of Jaiswal and Jurel. Krunal Pandya supported well with two scalps, including the RR captain Parag.<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/m42last_1745519125.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Riyan Parag (RR Captain)<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;I thought we bowled well, but we just didn&rsquo;t back it up with the bat. At the halfway stage of our chase, we were definitely in the driving seat, and honestly, we&rsquo;ve only got ourselves to blame.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>We didn&rsquo;t show enough intent against the spinners, and that hurt us in key phases.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>The support staff has given us complete freedom to express ourselves, so the onus is on us, the players, to step up and play with intent. In a tournament like this, even one poor decision can cost you, and that&rsquo;s what happened tonight.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>We talk a lot as a group&mdash;we&rsquo;ve discussed scenarios like this before, but unfortunately, we couldn&rsquo;t execute when it mattered. We were in control, and then we let it slip away.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>From here on, we have to play for pride. Some fans stand by us, and a lot of people behind the scenes who work incredibly hard for this team.It&rsquo;s an honour to represent this franchise, and we&rsquo;ll make sure that the next time we step on the field, we show that pride and fight.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Rajat Patidar (RCB Captain)<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;This was a much-needed win for us. The wicket played a bit differently than we expected, but full credit to the bowlers&mdash;they showed great courage and composure, and won us the game tonight.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>The opposition batted&nbsp;well&mdash;credit to them for taking it deep. At one point, we knew it was going to be a tight contest, but our focus remained on taking wickets, because that&rsquo;s how you control the run rate in such games. I usually go with my instincts first, but we have a strong group of leaders in the team. Their support and insights have been extremely valuable and are helping us make the right calls on the field.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Josh Hazlewood (Player of the Match)<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;First and foremost, it was about sticking to my strengths. On this surface, hard lengths were still tough to hit, so it was all about executing those deliveries consistently. Over the years, I haven&rsquo;t always had the opportunity to play a lot of T20 cricket, but it&#39;s been great getting those chances now. From my time with the Sydney Sixers, Chennai Super Kings, and now RCB, plus experiences with Australia, I&rsquo;ve gradually picked up what it takes to bowl in this format.&nbsp;Communication is key&mdash;we&rsquo;ve got a great group that shares ideas and bounces plans off one another. Everyone is backing each other, and tonight, it came together well to help us get the result. The bounce at Chinnaswamy has been quite steep throughout the tournament, which suits my bowling style. Full credit to our batters&mdash;they did a fantastic job to get us to that total. You&rsquo;re never completely sure here at Chinnaswamy, but they gave us something to work with, and we backed it up with the ball.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n",

      "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>This evening in Hyderabad, the Sunrisers Hyderabad take on the surging Mumbai Indians in what could be a defining contest for both sides.SRH, under Pat Cummins, are battling to stay relevant in the playoff race. Their campaign has been punctuated by flashes of brilliance from Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma at the top, but the middle order has lacked stability. Heinrich Klaasen&rsquo;s power has gone cold, and the team&rsquo;s finishing ability has come under question. The bowling, though spearheaded by Cummins and Bhuvneshwar Kumar, has failed to defend totals, especially in high-scoring conditions.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>In contrast, MI are starting to look like title contenders again. Rohit Sharma&rsquo;s return to form has added weight at the top, and Suryakumar Yadav is striking the ball with his usual flair. Tilak Varma has quietly become the glue in the middle. Add to that the menace of Jasprit Bumrah with the new ball and at the death, and MI suddenly look sharp, confident, and settled.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The Hyderabad pitch has been a batting paradise this season, with 200-plus scores becoming routine. Dew is expected, which means chasing will be an advantage.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>It&rsquo;s a must-win for SRH. It&rsquo;s momentum management for MI. Expect a cracker.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width_1745412482.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\nIPL Stats at Rajiv Gandhi International since 2024:<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (11)_1745414261.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\nPitch Report &ndash; Danny Morrison &amp; Matthew Hayden<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s <strong>scorching hot<\/strong> here in Hyderabad, and we&rsquo;re back on a pitch that has already hosted a couple of <strong>high-scoring encounters<\/strong> this season. The <strong>dimensions are slightly skewed<\/strong>&mdash;it&rsquo;s <strong>63 meters to the right<\/strong>, <strong>70 meters to the left<\/strong>, and a <strong>long 77 meters down the ground<\/strong>. This is the <strong>third time we&rsquo;re playing on this strip<\/strong>, and the same surface produced all those <strong>big totals<\/strong> earlier in the tournament. It&rsquo;s <strong>dry, hard<\/strong>, and has all the makings of a <strong>200-plus wicket<\/strong>&mdash;but as always, it will come down to <strong>who takes early advantage<\/strong> with the bat or the ball<br \/>\n<strong>Danny. While it may not be quite as explosive as that first game against Rajasthan, this is still a terrific batting surface. Both teams have a few skilled swing and seam operators, so the first few overs could be decisive. Once the ball stops moving, expect the batters to take charge. This is a surface that rewards positive intent.&quot;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (46)_1745415577.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>Toss Update:&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">MI won the toss and&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">elected to field first!<\/span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

Trent Boult was instrumental with the ball, striking twice in his opening spell to remove Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma, and returning at the death to dismiss Abhinav Manohar and captain Pat Cummins. Deepak Chahar also applied pressure with a tight 2-wicket haul, conceding just 12 runs in his four overs. Despite the early collapse, Heinrich Klaasen anchored the innings with a well-compiled 71 off 44 balls, supported briefly by Abhinav Manohar (43). However, SRH&#39;s inability to string together partnerships meant they finished with a below-par 143\/8.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Mumbai&rsquo;s chase was steady and controlled. Rohit Sharma top-scored with 70 off 46 deliveries, mixing boundaries with smart strike rotation. Will Jacks provided support with 22, while Suryakumar Yadav accelerated the innings late with a rapid 40* off 19 balls to finish the game in the 16th over.<\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Pat Cummins (Sunrisers Hyderabad Captain)<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>&quot;Yeah, I think Abhinav and Klaasy (Klaasen) did well to get us to a decent total, but we just couldn&#39;t build momentum after that. You need one batter to anchor the innings, and unfortunately, we kept losing wickets at regular intervals. We&rsquo;ve spoken about this before&mdash;you can take your time to build an innings, especially if you&#39;re a top-order batter. If you use up a few balls early on, you&#39;re good enough to catch up later. But starting 0 for 2 makes it really tough. It&#39;s all about reading the pitch and adapting accordingly. The contrast from our first game, where we scored 280, to this one, where we were bowled out cheaply&mdash;that&rsquo;s T20 cricket for you. It can swing either way, and it just hasn&#39;t clicked for us in the last couple of games. We&rsquo;ve got a few away games coming up now. So it&rsquo;s going to be about assessing each wicket, figuring out what&#39;s a good score, and planning our innings accordingly. That&rsquo;s going to be a big part of our discussions moving forward.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Hardik Pandya (Mumbai Indians Captain)<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;Honestly, it feels great to get the win under our belt. Momentum is key in tournaments like these, and I&rsquo;m glad the boys are starting to find their rhythm. This team has always had the potential&mdash;I&#39;ve always believed that once everyone starts clicking, we&rsquo;ll be hard to stop. Today was a great example: Deepak and Boult bowled brilliantly, Rohit gave us a solid start, and Surya finished it off in style.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Captaincy, for me, is all about instincts. I do have plans going into the game, but I also believe in reading the situation and reacting. Chahar bowled really well in the powerplay, so I felt there was no reason to hold him back.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">At that point, they were five wickets down, and we wanted to force a mistake. We knew they wouldn&rsquo;t take too many chances against Santner, so we thought we&rsquo;d throw something different at them. Puthur is a young guy, and these things happen&mdash;it&rsquo;s all part of learning.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">We&rsquo;ve been focusing on getting better in all departments, and we&rsquo;ve talked about being smart and clinical as a unit. So far, I&rsquo;m very satisfied with how things are shaping up.&quot;<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Trent Boult (Player of the Match)<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;It&rsquo;s always nice to contribute to a good team win. This was a big game for us, and to restrict such a quality side to a manageable total on their home ground was very satisfying. It&rsquo;s the old rule of thumb&mdash;just hit the wicket, keep it simple, and try to make the batters play the tougher shots.&nbsp;Deepak did a tremendous job from the other end, bowling four on the trot again and keeping the pressure on. Our goal as a bowling group is to build pressure and force mistakes. It was also great to see a couple of catches stick, which always makes a difference in games like these.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n",

In the <strong>first game here<\/strong>, LSG scored <strong>172<\/strong>, but it was <strong>chased down comfortably<\/strong> by Punjab Kings. So this could very well be a <strong>&lsquo;win the toss and chase&rsquo; kind of pitch<\/strong>.&quot;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n&quot;It looks like a <strong>really nice surface<\/strong>. The <strong>hardness of the pitch<\/strong> is the first thing I noticed&mdash;it&rsquo;s clearly had <strong>a lot of rolling<\/strong>. When I touched it, I felt like strapping on the pads myself! With <strong>red soil<\/strong>, you get natural <strong>pace and bounce<\/strong> for the quicks. But there&rsquo;s also a bit of <strong>grip for the spinners<\/strong>, especially early on. This is going to be a <strong>true cricket wicket<\/strong>&mdash;if you <strong>bowl well<\/strong>, you&rsquo;ll be rewarded. And if you <strong>bat well<\/strong>, there are runs to be scored all around the park.<br \/>\nThe <strong>Lucknow Super Giants&rsquo; top three<\/strong> will be eyeing this surface to cash in&mdash;they&rsquo;ll want to make full use of the conditions&quot;<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (45)_1745329381.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>Toss Update<span style=\"color:#c0392b\">: DC Won the Toss and elected to field first!<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

With this victory, DC showed balance, intent, and ruthlessness.<\/p>\n\n<p>Put into bat, Lucknow Super Giants rode on Aiden Markram&rsquo;s fluent 52 (33) and a brisk 36 from Ayush Badoni. But from 87\/0, they lost 6 wickets for just 72 runs, derailing their momentum.

Once Porel fell, it was the KL-Axar show &mdash; controlled, classy, and calmly finished.<\/p>\n\n<p>Markram picked up two wickets with the ball, but DC&rsquo;s top-order composure and LSG&rsquo;s bowling struggles made the difference.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/m40result_1745343338.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Rishabh Pant (Lucknow Super Giants Captain)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;Yes, definitely. We knew we were around 20 runs short today. In Lucknow, the toss plays a huge role&mdash;whoever bowls first tends to get a lot of assistance from the surface. We needed to stay in the game longer, but we couldn&rsquo;t quite get away with the bat when it mattered. That&rsquo;s the nature of this venue. In second innings, the pitch gets increasingly difficult to bat on. But that&rsquo;s how it goes&mdash;we&rsquo;re not here to make excuses. As a team, we&rsquo;re focused on learning and improving.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>[On not using Mayank as Impact Sub]<br \/>\nMayank just came back from the NCA, and we&rsquo;re trying to find the right role and place for him in the XI.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>[On batting lower down the order]<br \/>\nThe idea was to capitalize early. We sent Samad up the order for that reason. Then Miller came in, but we got a bit stuck in the middle. It&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;ll reflect on. We&rsquo;ve got to keep finding ways to adapt and improve.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>[Looking ahead]<br \/>\nWe haven&rsquo;t thought about the next game yet. Right now, it&rsquo;s about regrouping, resetting, and going into the next match with a fresh mindset.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Axar Patel (Delhi Capitals Captain)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;It was an up-and-down game. We didn&rsquo;t pick up wickets during the powerplay, but we did well to restrict the total and stay in the contest. Throughout the innings, we were focused on breaking partnerships, and every bowler stepped up to pull things back brilliantly.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>[On his own bowling]<br \/>\nAs captain, I chose to start with the first over myself. I&rsquo;ve been managing a finger injury, which is why I hadn&rsquo;t bowled much recently. But I&rsquo;m feeling a lot better now, and I bowled again in the powerplay.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>When you&rsquo;re in good rhythm, it becomes easier to bowl four overs on the trot.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>[Tactical decisions]<br \/>\nI kept an eye on match-ups and how the pitch was behaving. I used pacers strategically, especially considering the boundary dimensions. When Pooran came to bat, I remembered Starc dismissing him in the last game, so I brought him on straightaway to try and repeat that matchup.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>[Batting at No. 4]<br \/>\nI bat according to the situation and try to take on bowlers based on my strengths. I have a clear mindset&mdash;when I promote myself, I already know who I want to target on the opposition side. It&rsquo;s worked well for me so far, and I hope that continues.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>[Areas for improvement]<br \/>\nFielding is one area we really need to improve. You can have an off day with bat or ball, but we&rsquo;ve been dropping catches consistently, and that hurts&mdash;especially when bowlers are executing plans well.&nbsp;Even with those lapses, we did well to keep them under 160, which was a solid result under the circumstances.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Mukesh Kumar (Player of the Match)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;I&rsquo;m feeling really good tonight. I enjoyed bowling on this wicket&mdash;it suited my style well.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>When I came on to bowl my second over, I had a quick chat with Chameera and Starc, and they mentioned that the ball was stopping off the surface a bit. That helped me plan my approach. I focused on hitting the right lengths and mixing in my variations effectively.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>I always like to stay in conversation with the skipper&mdash;he gave me clear instructions on maintaining a consistent length and using slower deliveries at the right moments. I stuck to that plan, and it worked.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>[On his favourite wicket]<br \/>\nFor me, the most important wicket was Mitchell Marsh. He was set in the middle and could have done serious damage later on. Getting him out at that stage was crucial for our team.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>[On his overall performance]<br \/>\nI&rsquo;m genuinely happy with how I performed today. I&rsquo;ve been looking for a performance like this all season&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t quite coming together in the first half, but I&rsquo;m glad it clicked tonight. I just want to carry this momentum forward and keep contributing for the team.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n",

      "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up&mdash;because Eden Gardens is about to witness a sizzler! In one corner, we have the Gujarat Titans&mdash;confident, clinical, and cruising at the top. In the other, Kolkata Knight Riders&mdash;a team with a point to prove, bruised but still dangerous, fighting for survival in the league. This isn&rsquo;t just a game&mdash;it&rsquo;s a battle of belief, bottle, and brilliance.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>KKR, led by Ajinkya Rahane, have blown hot and cold this season. Rahane&rsquo;s experience has anchored their innings repeatedly, but it&rsquo;s high time the likes of De Kock, Russell, and Narine brought their A-game to the party. With spin-friendly conditions, Varun Chakaravarthy and Narine could be KKR&rsquo;s trump cards&mdash;if they can crack GT&rsquo;s power-packed top order.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Speaking of GT&mdash;what a juggernaut they&rsquo;ve been! The Englishman Jos Buttler is in red-hot form, smashing an unbeaten 97 in the last match. Sai Sudharsan is piling up runs for fun and breathing down the neck of the Orange Cap leader. And Prasidh Krishna? Fourteen wickets and counting&mdash;he&rsquo;s been venomous with the new ball and brutal at the death.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>But here&rsquo;s the deal&mdash;Eden Gardens is no stranger to drama. Two pitches have been prepared; the buzz is that one favors seamers and the other slow turners. The toss could be worth its weight in gold, especially with dew expected later in the night.<\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (30)_1745243248.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report |&nbsp; Nick Knight &amp; Eoin Morgan&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&quot;The defending champions are back at their fortress, and they&rsquo;ll be desperate to pick up two crucial points tonight. Let&rsquo;s talk about the pitch.&nbsp;This is a very Eden Gardens-like pitch. There&rsquo;s grass covering, especially around the good length and short-of-a-length areas. That tells us we can expect a consistent bounce and decent pace tonight .From what we&rsquo;ve seen in past games here, early swing is often a factor, particularly in the first couple of overs. So bowlers will want to make full use of that upfront. Now, if there wasn&rsquo;t as much grass, we might&rsquo;ve expected a bit of turn&mdash;but not tonight. The surface won&rsquo;t offer much assistance for spinners, so they&rsquo;ll be in for a challenge.All signs point to a high-scoring contest, but there could be movement with the new ball early on. The key for KKR is early wickets. They have to utilize the swing while it lasts. Guys like Harshit Rana and Vaibhav Arora must pitch it up, just as they did against SRH, and look for movement.GT&rsquo;s top three have been batting deep into the powerplay. If KKR can disrupt that rhythm early, it&rsquo;ll put pressure on GT&rsquo;s middle order, who haven&rsquo;t been tested as much.

We did well to come back into the game with the ball. But while chasing a total like that, you need a strong start, and that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;ve been struggling throughout this tournament.The pitch was a little on the slower side. When we were bowling, our goal was to keep them below 200, which we managed. But then, in the middle overs, we couldn&rsquo;t quite string together the partnerships we needed. That&rsquo;s another phase where we need to improve.I have no complaints with our bowlers&mdash;they&rsquo;ve been executing really well.Fielding is one area we can control better as a team. If we can save even 15&ndash;20 runs in the field, it could make a massive difference in a game like this. Staying switched on throughout the innings is crucial, and the boys are working hard on that.This format is all about being brave. We can&rsquo;t dwell too much on what&rsquo;s happened in previous games. Whether we&rsquo;re winning or not, we have to keep looking for small improvements&mdash;even 1% better can make an impact.As a batting unit, I tell the guys it&rsquo;s okay to get out trying to hit a boundary. You&rsquo;ve got to show intent and play fearlessly. We have some quality batters, especially in the middle overs, and I fully back them to step up.Great to see him doing well. He&rsquo;s been batting really well, and today we decided to push the other batters to help bring the required run rate under control. The intent was right&mdash;we just need to execute a bit better moving forward.&quot;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Shubman Gill | GT Captain &amp; Player of the Match:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;Very pleased with the result&mdash;two wins in a row is always a great feeling.Our focus is simple: play our best cricket and maximize scoring opportunities based on the pitch conditions. We talk more about how we can approach each surface rather than fixating on results. The idea is always to take the game deep and give ourselves the best chance to post or chase down a strong total.We were ahead in the game for most of it&mdash;but as we know, closing games is a different challenge. Top teams know how to finish the job, and that&rsquo;s what I was expressing&mdash;those were the emotions of wanting to close it properly.It&rsquo;s hard to play a perfect T20 game. There will always be a few things you wish you did better. For example, I feel we could&rsquo;ve scored 10 more runs if I had stayed on. We also made a couple of unforced errors in key moments.But that&rsquo;s the beauty of the format&mdash;even when you&rsquo;re not playing perfectly, the best teams find a way to win, and that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing well as a group.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n",

      "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>The El Cl&aacute;sico of the IPL is back! Five-time champions Mumbai Indians (MI) and Chennai Super Kings (CSK) collide at the Wankhede Stadium tonight in a high-voltage showdown dripping with history, pride, and playoff implications. MI, riding a resurgent wave with three consecutive wins,seek revenge for their earlier loss to CSK, while the struggling Yellow Army&mdash;anchored by the legendary MS Dhoni&mdash;fights to keep their faint playoff hopes alive after snapping a five-match losing streak. &nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe numbers narrate a fierce rivalry: MI lead 20-18 in 38 clashes,but CSK have dominated recent meetings with five wins in six games. Wankhede&rsquo;s flat deck and dew-laden evenings favor chasing sides, setting the stage for tactical fireworks. MI&rsquo;s Suryakumar Yadav, the *360-degree maverick,faces a spin test against CSK&rsquo;s Afghan sensation Noor Ahmad, while Hardik Pandya&rsquo;s all-round flair and Jasprit Bumrah&rsquo;s death-overs mastery add intrigue. For CSK, Dhoni&rsquo;s finishing aura&mdash;evident in his recent 11-ball 26&mdash;and Rachin Ravindra&rsquo;s resurgence loom large. &nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\nWith clear skies and a 184-run average first-innings score in the last two years, expect a run-fest under lights.The toss could be pivotal: two of three Wankhede games this season were won by chasers.<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (24)_1745154224.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>VENUE STATS:-<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (10)_1745155775.jpg\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:-<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Simon Doull:-<\/strong>&nbsp;&quot;We&#39;re back on Pitch No. 8, and the dimensions are quite striking &mdash; just 60 meters on one side with a slight breeze, 66 meters towards the east, and 73 meters straight down the ground. The last game on this surface saw a mammoth 430 runs scored, and there&rsquo;s every chance we&rsquo;re in for another run-fest. This pitch appears a bit drier than what we saw on Thursday night. The center has a consistent grass covering, but the areas around a fuller length are noticeably more parched, which could bring a bit more spin into play. There was a hint of tackiness for the side batting first last time, but that doesn&#39;t seem to be the case today. This looks like a true, solid batting surface. Given the typical dew factor that sets in during the evening, both teams are likely to prefer chasing. It&rsquo;s a surface made for runs &mdash; putting a total on the board may work, but with dew coming in, batting second might just be the easier path. Expect a high-scoring affair.&quot;<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (43)_1745157124.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:-<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>TOSS HAS FAVOURED THE HOME TEAM AND MUMBAI WILL FIELD FIRST!<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

The innings got a push from young Ayush Mhatre, who impressed on debut with a blistering 32 off just 15 balls, while Shivam Dube (50 off 32) and Ravindra Jadeja (53* off 35) combined to anchor the middle and late overs. However, MI pulled things back with Bumrah&rsquo;s precise death bowling (2\/25), keeping the visitors from breaching 180.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Chasing 177, Mumbai started with a bang. Ryan Rickelton played the aggressor early, but once he fell for 24, it was the Rohit-Suryakumar show all the way. Rohit Sharma turned back the clock with a classy 76* off 45 balls, mixing power and placement with ease. At the other end, Suryakumar Yadav was in his element &ndash; reverse sweeps, lofts, flicks &ndash; all on display in his stunning 68* off just 30.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The duo added 114 runs in just 51 balls, completely deflating CSK&rsquo;s bowling attack, which lacked venom on the night. Pathirana and Noor Ahmad came in for some serious punishment, going at over 12 an over.<\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h3><strong>MS Dhoni (Chennai Super Kings Captain)<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>&quot;I think we were quite below par today. We knew the dew would come into play, so we planned to create pressure during the middle overs.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>In hindsight, we probably should have accelerated earlier, especially before Bumrah came into the attack. He&rsquo;s one of the best death bowlers in the world, and once he started his spell, it became much harder to score freely.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>175 was never a par score on this ground&mdash;we needed to push harder and carry more momentum into the back end of our innings.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>[On Ayush Mhatre]<br \/>\nAs a youngster, I thought he batted well tonight. His shot selection was impressive, and right from the start, he played with positive intent. We haven&rsquo;t seen much of him yet, but it was a very promising knock.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>The dew became a factor in the second innings. While the ball did grip a little, they played spin exceptionally well. Especially Surya&mdash;he&rsquo;s a fantastic player of spin, and once the ball came nicely onto the bat, it was always going to be tough for us.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>[On the approach going forward]<br \/>\nWe need to be practical, not emotional. To be successful, you have to play good, smart cricket. We also dropped a few catches today, which hurt us.<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>It&rsquo;s important to take it one game at a time. Even if we lose a couple, the goal is to find the right combination moving forward. We don&rsquo;t want to make too many changes.&nbsp;Of course, we&rsquo;re aiming to make the playoffs. But if we don&rsquo;t, our focus will shift to building a settled XI and coming back stronger next season.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h3><strong>Hardik Pandya (Mumbai Indians Captain)<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;The way we&rsquo;re approaching the game right now, we knew it was going to be a high-scoring contest, and we backed ourselves by playing the percentages.No need to worry about Rohit&#39;s form&mdash;he&rsquo;s a big-match player. When he clicks, the opposition is usually out of the game. And tonight, the way Surya batted was exceptional. That partnership between them truly took the game away. We&rsquo;re keeping things simple&mdash;sticking to the basics, playing smart cricket, and executing the plans we&rsquo;ve committed to. In hindsight, yes, we might&rsquo;ve been able to sneak in an over or two differently, but we were always playing catch-up. At the end of the day, a total around 175&ndash;180 was below par on this surface.I don&rsquo;t think we were too far away from a win&mdash;we just needed to put all the pieces together. That&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;ll keep working on moving forward.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h3><strong>Rohit Sharma (Player of the Match)<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">[On fans in yellow jerseys cheering for him]<br \/>\nThat&rsquo;s the beauty of Wankhede. The fans here love the game, and that&rsquo;s what makes this place so special. Whether you&#39;re wearing yellow or blue, when people appreciate good cricket, it&rsquo;s heartwarming. Today was one of those games.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Having been around for a long time, it&#39;s easy to fall into self-doubt or try to overcomplicate things. For me, the key was to go back to basics, keep it simple, and maintain a clear mindset. That&rsquo;s how I like to plan my innings&mdash;hold my shape, extend through the line, and when the ball is in my zone, I know what I have to do.We had a chat about the batting order&mdash;whether to come in immediately after fielding. Honestly, two or three overs don&rsquo;t make a huge difference, and even if I haven&rsquo;t been on the field for long, I&rsquo;m happy to walk straight in if that&rsquo;s what the team needs. That upper stand feels far away when you&rsquo;re in the middle, but I loved being out there today. For me, staying in the middle and finishing games is what gives me the most satisfaction. We&rsquo;re peaking at the right time, three wins in a row now, and the momentum is building.On a personal note, it&rsquo;s a huge honour. I&rsquo;ve said this before&mdash;as a kid growing up, there was a time when we weren&rsquo;t even allowed inside this stadium. And now, to have played all my cricket here&mdash;it means everything. Whenever that &#39;Rohit Sharma at Wankhede&#39; chant goes up, honestly... I still don&rsquo;t know how to react. It&rsquo;s pure emotion.<\/span><\/p>\n",

      "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>In a swift turnaround, the Punjab Kings (PBKS) are set to host the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) in Match 37 of the TATA IPL 2025 at the Maharaja Yadavindra Singh International Stadium in Mullanpur, just 40 hours after their previous encounter. In that rain-shortened 14-over match, PBKS secured a five-wicket victory, handing RCB their third consecutive home defeat.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>RCB, under the leadership of Rajat Patidar, have exhibited contrasting performances this season. While they boast an impeccable away record with four wins, their home form has been lackluster. The batting trio of Virat Kohli, Patidar, and Phil Salt has been instrumental in their victories, but the team will be eager to bounce back from their recent loss.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>On the other hand, PBKS, captained by Shreyas Iyer, have been in impressive form, winning five out of their last seven matches. Their bowling unit, led by Yuzvendra Chahal and Arshdeep Singh, has been particularly effective, especially in defending low totals. The team will aim to continue their winning momentum and solidify their position in the top half of the table.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;As the two teams prepare for this crucial encounter, the question remains: Will RCB maintain their flawless away record, or will PBKS continue their ascent in the standings?<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (23)_1745140425.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>VENUE STATS:-<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (9)_1745141273.jpg\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:-<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Varun Aaron: &quot;The boundaries here are 63 meters on one side, 70 meters on the other, and 76 meters straight down the ground. There&#39;s a breeze flowing along the ground, which could play a role in the game. The wicket looks solid and in great condition. It&rsquo;s pitch number three, and the last match here, between PBKS and CSK, saw a massive total of 420 runs. While the pitch has a few cracks, the grass covering should help keep it together. Overall, it seems like a pitch where the ball will come onto the bat nicely.&quot;<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (42)_1745142910.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:-<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>RAJAT CALLS RIGHT AT THE TOSS AND RCB ELECT TO FIELD FIRST!&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" \/><\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>????

Devdutt Padikkal, aggressive from the get-go, smashed a blistering 61 off just 35 balls, peppering the boundaries with flair. Their 103-run stand for the second wicket shut the door on any PBKS hopes early.<\/p>\n\n<p>Earlier, Punjab Kings started brightly with the bat. Openers Priyansh Arya (22 off 15) and Prabhsimran Singh (33 off 17) gave them a turbocharged start. But Krunal Pandya&#39;s crafty spell (2\/25) and Suyash Sharma&rsquo;s guile (2\/26) put the brakes on their innings. Despite a late push from Shashank Singh (31*) and Marco Jansen (25*), PBKS could only muster 157\/6.<\/p>\n\n<p>RCB&rsquo;s bowlers kept things tight, and their batters chased it down with 7 balls to spare. Kohli&rsquo;s form continues to shine, and with five wins in five away games, Bengaluru are turning into road warriors.<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/Post37_1745157452.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h3><strong>Shreyas Iyer (Punjab Kings Captain)<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">&quot;The body feels good&mdash;just a minor niggle. I should be fine after this game.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Looking at our batting, I feel most of our players are looking to go big right from ball one. We&#39;re not assessing the conditions well enough. In these afternoon games, the pitch tends to slow down considerably, and we haven&rsquo;t been able to post totals that we can defend.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">We&rsquo;ve been getting decent starts, but we&rsquo;re not capitalizing during the middle phase. That&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re falling short.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Credit to Virat and his team&mdash;they played tremendously well. It was a comprehensive win for them.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Yes, adapting to the surface is something we talk about regularly. Once the ball gets older, it stops skidding and becomes harder to play strokes. We have naturally positive players, but the middle-order needs to step up and ensure we put up defendable totals for our bowlers.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Personally, I feel I&rsquo;m in a great headspace. I don&rsquo;t want to make excuses or play with fear. We need to be free-flowing, not dwell on past performances, and make the most of the starts we&rsquo;ve been getting.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">We now have a six-day break, which comes at a good time. We&rsquo;ve been on the road for a while and it does take a toll on the body. It&rsquo;s important that we recover well and come back in top shape for the next game.&quot;<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h3><strong>Rajat Patidar (Royal Challengers Bengaluru Captain)<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;Yes, full credit goes to the bowlers&mdash;the way they executed the plans and how each one contributed at different stages was just brilliant to watch.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>The message was simple: bowl tight lines, stick to the stumps, and keep it disciplined. That was our focus going into the match.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>We had a chat at the team hotel last night, especially about fielding strategies for the second half. There was clear intent behind those discussions, and credit to the boys&mdash;they followed through and put in the effort. It showed out there.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Looking ahead, first of all, I&rsquo;ll need to win the toss (smiles). But more importantly, we&rsquo;ll focus on playing good cricket and look to rectify the areas we still need to improve. That&rsquo;s the goal moving forward.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h3><strong>Virat Kohli (Player of the Match)<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;Yeah, this was an important game for us. Moving from 8 to 10 points makes a huge difference in the qualification race. We&rsquo;ve set ourselves up nicely now, and the way we&rsquo;ve played, especially away from home, has been fantastic. The mindset remains simple&mdash;get those 2 points for the team.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>There have been times when I&rsquo;ve wanted to accelerate more, but I feel my role shifts depending on the situation&mdash;especially if Salt doesn&rsquo;t get going. Then it becomes important for me to anchor the innings.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Honestly, I don&rsquo;t know why I got this award today&mdash;Dev really created the impact that shifted the game. I just used my experience to close it out. I enjoy playing that role&mdash;holding one end, assessing the conditions, and accelerating when needed.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>It&rsquo;s tempting to go hard every game, but we have to read the conditions. We took learnings from the first two games. The last one was shortened, so we had to go after it. But in general, understanding the surface and adapting is key.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>When you&rsquo;re at a new venue, one good partnership is often enough in T20s. For me, it&rsquo;s about knowing the strengths of others, giving them the freedom to express themselves, and making sure one end is held together.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Credit to the auction planning&mdash;we got the team we wanted. Jitesh, Salt, and Dev have been playing outstanding roles, and the addition of Romario has boosted our lower-order firepower, something we lacked in recent seasons.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>This season, even if the top order fails, we know there are players who can still take the game deep. When you have that kind of depth and belief, your chances of winning go up significantly.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n",

The Royals, currently languishing at eighth on the points table with just two wins from seven matches, are desperate to turn their fortunes around. Their campaign has been marred by inconsistency, and the fitness of captain Sanju Samson remains a concern after he suffered a side strain in the previous game.On the other hand, the Super Giants are sitting comfortably at fifth, boasting four wins from seven outings. Their batting lineup has been firing on all cylinders, with Nicholas Pooran leading the charge with 357 runs. The return of pace sensation Mayank Yadav from injury could further bolster their bowling attack. The pitch at Jaipur has been a balanced one, offering something for both batters and bowlers. With conditions ideal for a thrilling contest, buckle up for a rollercoaster ride of IPL action as the Royals and Super Giants battle it out under the lights in Jaipur!<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (22)_1745069013.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\nIPL Stats at Sawai Mansingh Since 2024:<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 - 2025-04-19T183540_1745069065.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/>&nbsp;<\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report &ndash; Simon Katich &amp; Shane Watson<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&quot;We&rsquo;re standing on <strong>Pitch Number 5<\/strong>, and at first glance, there&rsquo;s a nice, even coverage of grass across the surface.

Batting first, LSG rode on solid knocks from Aiden Markram (66 off 45) and Ayush Badoni (50 off 34), who stitched a crucial 76-run partnership to steady the innings.

Emotions are all over the place.I don&rsquo;t exactly know where we went wrong&mdash;we were in the game right up until the 19th over. After that, things just slipped away.Someone has to take responsibility, and I&rsquo;m willing to own it. I&rsquo;ll put my hand up&mdash;it was on me. We should have finished the game.To win matches consistently, we need to collectively play all 40 overs as a unit. Only then can we expect results to go our way.I thought we bowled really well for most of the innings. The final over was just unfortunate. I genuinely believed we could restrict them to 165&ndash;170, but that last over hurt us.Sandy bhai (Sandeep Sharma) had an off day&mdash;it happens&mdash;and Abdul Samad batted brilliantly. Those 15&ndash;20 extra runs made a big difference.The pitch was perfect today. We knew exactly how it would play. No excuses&mdash;we have to blame ourselves for not executing when it mattered.&quot;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Rishabh Pant |&nbsp;Lucknow Super Giants&nbsp;<\/strong><strong>Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Wins like these are special&mdash;they build character and resilience. It was an amazing win, and I truly believe this is the kind of performance that takes us to the next level as a team.These are the positives we always talk about in the dressing room, and it&rsquo;s great to see them play out on the field. We&rsquo;re definitely moving in the right direction.Full credit to the bowlers for holding their nerve&mdash;especially in high-pressure moments. It&rsquo;s never easy when you&rsquo;re chasing the game, but they showed composure.Avesh was fantastic&mdash;the way he executed under pressure, particularly in the final over, was outstanding.The message was simple: take your time, stay clear in your mind, and focus on executing one ball at a time. That approach worked for us tonight.For now, I&rsquo;m just enjoying the win&mdash;it was a much-needed one, and hopefully, there&rsquo;s more to come.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Avesh Khan | Player of the Match:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>The hand&rsquo;s okay now. For a moment, I thought it was broken&mdash;I got hit right where I was holding my phone and literally saw stars. Didn&rsquo;t even get the time to celebrate properly!I don&rsquo;t want to be the next Mitchell Starc&mdash;I want to be the best version of Avesh Khan. My focus is on bowling with clarity and executing my plans with precision.I don&rsquo;t pay too much attention to the scoreboard while bowling. My goal is to back my execution. The idea, especially in the final over, was to restrict boundaries in the first three balls to build pressure on the batters.When the ball went up, I saw David Miller and thought, &lsquo;He&rsquo;s got it.&rsquo; Saving six runs is critical&mdash;especially on grounds like this, where even mistimed shots can fly to the boundary.We were mostly discussing field placements&mdash;especially who should go out to the deep. I&rsquo;m learning to understand my own bowling patterns, which helps in making those decisions.I always put the team first. Tonight, I just wanted to win the game for us. We&rsquo;ve got six more matches to go, and I&rsquo;ll give my all to help us win those too&mdash;with more performances like this one.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n",

Expect fireworks from the top order &ndash; Gill, Sai Sudharsan, and the ever-explosive Jos Buttler. But it&rsquo;s the pace battery of Siraj and Prasidh Krishna that&rsquo;s been turning heads &ndash; raw pace, red-hot rhythm, and eyes firmly set on that Purple Cap.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Meanwhile, Delhi are riding a high. Captain Axar Patel has quietly marshaled his troops with precision. KL Rahul has been the calm in the storm at the top, while Tristan Stubbs is doing what Stubbs does best &ndash; lighting up the stage with fearless batting. Add the menace of Starc and the mystery of Kuldeep to the mix, and you&rsquo;ve got a bowling attack that&rsquo;s got teeth.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The Narendra Modi Stadium pitch? A belter! Expect runs galore, sixes raining, and bowlers praying for mercy.&nbsp;This isn&rsquo;t just a match, folks &ndash; this is a battle for supremacy.

Buttler remained unbeaten on 97 off 54 balls, with Rahul Tewatia applying the final touches in typical ice-cold style.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>DC were off to a flier, thanks to Abishek Porel&rsquo;s fiery 18 (9) and KL Rahul&rsquo;s explosive 28 (14). Karun Nair continued his resurgence with a quick 31, while skipper Axar Patel held the innings together with 39 (32). A late blitz from Ashutosh Sharma (37 off 19) catapulted DC past the 200-mark.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>But the star with the ball was Prasidh Krishna, who continued his golden season, finishing with 4\/41, including the key wickets of Rahul, Axar, and Nair. Despite a few costly overs from Siraj and Arshad, GT managed to restrict the death overs just enough to stay in the hunt.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Chasing 204, GT lost Gill early to a direct hit from Nair, but the innings belonged to Jos Buttler. He went from elegant to explosive, mixing finesse with firepower as he clobbered 11 fours and 4 sixes en route to an unbeaten 97 (54).<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Sai Sudharsan (36 off 21) gave the early momentum, while Sherfane Rutherford (43 off 34) matched Buttler shot for shot in the middle overs. DC&rsquo;s bowlers had no answers under pressure, with Starc leaking 49 runs in just 3.2 overs.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Just when things looked tight, Tewatia walked in and did what Tewatia does best &mdash; a six and a four off Starc in the final over to seal the deal.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/image (52)_1745072358.png\" style=\"width:640px\" \/>&nbsp;<\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Axar Patel | Delhi Capitals Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;I think we were 10&ndash;15 runs short, and in the end, that made the difference.Every time we tried to accelerate, we lost wickets and couldn&rsquo;t build lasting partnerships. We needed to find a few more boundaries.I thought our bowlers did a really good job, but some missed chances in the field&mdash;dropped catches and small lapses&mdash;also cost us.No need to overthink it. These were small moments&mdash;just one or two hits or tighter fielding decisions&mdash;and we could&rsquo;ve turned it around. We just need to avoid repeating those mistakes.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Shubman Gill | Gujarat Titans Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;The way we pulled things back with the ball was impressive. At one stage, it looked like they&rsquo;d get 230&ndash;240, but our bowlers stepped up and brought us back into the contest.We&rsquo;ve done well chasing throughout the tournament. Even in the last game chasing 245, we stayed in the game right till the end.With Axar still at the crease, we chose to stick with pace to keep things tight and avoid giving momentum away.Personally, it was a disappointing way to get out, but there are plenty of matches left, and I&rsquo;ll look to bounce back.The way Buttler and Rutherford batted was incredible. They rotated strike well and picked the right moments to attack. Their execution was spot on.We&rsquo;ve got back-to-back matches now&mdash;today and then at Eden. If we can win both, we&rsquo;ll be in a strong position on the points table.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Jos Buttler | Player of the Match:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;Really pleased to come away with two points and a win. It was a beautiful pitch to bat on, and we picked our moments well, building good partnerships along the way.The heat was intense&mdash;it really hits you out there. You don&rsquo;t realize how draining it can be, but it&rsquo;s part of the challenge. You&#39;ve got to stay fit and perform under pressure, even in tough conditions.I&rsquo;ve not kept that well in the last six games, so I was eager to improve. Felt nice to take that catch&mdash;it gives you a bit of confidence.It&rsquo;s been a pleasure. He&rsquo;s got serious power&mdash;can hit sixes from nowhere. That over against Mohit, where he hit two sixes, swung momentum our way.<br \/>\nOf course, you want to get a century, but the main thing is winning the game. I had my chances but couldn&rsquo;t convert. I told Rahul not to worry about me&mdash;we needed to finish the match. He&rsquo;s done it many times before, calm under pressure and finding the fence from ball one.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n",

Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru, where tonight, under the dazzling lights, Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) lock horns with Punjab Kings (PBKS) in Match 34 of IPL 2025! Both teams stride into this contest with identical records&mdash;four wins from six outings&mdash;making this clash pivotal in the race for playoff supremacy.RCB, despite their formidable lineup, have yet to taste victory at home this season. But with Virat Kohli leading the charge and the likes of Phil Salt and Rajat Patidar in the mix, the home crowd will be hoping for a change in fortunes. Conversely, PBKS arrive with momentum, having pulled off a sensational defense of a low total against KKR. Their bowling arsenal, featuring Arshdeep Singh and Yuzvendra Chahal, will be keen to exploit any chinks in RCB&#39;s armor. The pitch at Chinnaswamy is a batter&#39;s paradise, promising a run-fest. But with the weather playing coy, a few rain interruptions could spice things up.So, buckle up, folks!

What began as a power-hitting showcase from Tim David became a redemption story for Nehal Wadhera as Punjab Kings defeated Royal Challengers Bengaluru by 5 wickets, registering back-to-back wins in the 2025 IPL season.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Toss eventually took place at 9:30 PM IST, with the game reduced to 14 overs a side. The pitch was tacky, and the powerplay just four overs. Every ball was crucial. RCB were put in to bat and that&rsquo;s where the troubles began.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>RCB&rsquo;s innings never got going. Phil Salt, Virat Kohli, and Liam Livingstone all fell cheaply as Arshdeep Singh and Marco Jansen wrecked the top-order. Skipper Rajat Patidar tried to counter but fell to Chahal after a brief 23. From there, RCB slid to 42\/7, and it looked like a sub-80 score was on the cards.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>In what turned out to be a rescue act of the highest quality, David smashed an unbeaten 50 off just 26 balls, peppering with five boundaries and three sixes. He clobbered Harpreet Brar in the final over, taking RCB to a competitive 95\/9 in 14 overs &mdash; a score that once seemed out of reach.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>PBKS started briskly with Priyansh Arya and Prabhsimran Singh, but Hazlewood and Bhuvi struck in the powerplay to dent their momentum. Inglis and skipper Shreyas Iyer also departed in quick succession, leaving Punjab reeling at 53\/4.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>But Nehal Wadhera, cool as ever, absorbed the pressure and counter-punched in style. He stitched together vital runs with calculated aggression, hitting 33* off 19 balls, including a six and a four.&nbsp;Marcus Stoinis finished it off with a towering six, as Punjab chased down the target in 12.1 overs, clinching the game with 11 balls to spare.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\n<strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/Post34_1745003432.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Rajat Patidar | Royal Challengers Bengaluru Captain<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;Early on, the pitch was sticking a bit and felt two-paced. We could&rsquo;ve certainly done a lot better as a batting unit.When you&rsquo;re batting first, partnerships become crucial. Unfortunately, we kept losing wickets at regular intervals and couldn&rsquo;t build any momentum.It was a conditions-based decision&mdash;we had to make that change to adapt.Honestly, it wasn&rsquo;t a bad wicket. It had been under covers for quite some time, and that may have helped Punjab a bit. Credit to their bowlers for exploiting those conditions. But as a batting unit, we should&rsquo;ve been good enough to post a competitive total.Our bowling unit has been consistent and doing really well. Even with the bat, there was good intent&mdash;it didn&rsquo;t click today, but sometimes that&rsquo;s how it goes. It&rsquo;s just a matter of time before it all comes together.We face Punjab again in a few days. Our focus will be on correcting the errors in the batting department&mdash;we&rsquo;ll review, reset, and come back stronger.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Shreyas Iyer | Punjab Kings Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;Variety is the spice of life&mdash;and this season, we&rsquo;ve certainly experienced all kinds of games!Tonight, a lot of our decisions were instinctive. Marco Jansen used the bounce beautifully, and the rest of the bowling unit backed him up brilliantly. Honestly, I didn&rsquo;t expect the surface to play the way it did, but the bowlers adapted really well.One observation&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t see a single six hit straight down the ground off a pacer, which shows how tricky the pitch was.Nehal was outstanding with his approach&mdash;composed, proactive, and very effective.I also had a personal chat with Chahal. He&rsquo;s got the quality to bounce back anytime. In fact, I&rsquo;d say he&rsquo;s probably been the best bowler in the IPL so far. Of course, performance also depends on the surface, but he&rsquo;s always in the game.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Tim David | Player of the Match:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;It didn&rsquo;t feel all that easy out there tonight.I had a chance to assess the conditions and get a feel for how the pitch was playing, which helped me adapt as the innings went on.Look, our coaching staff has built this squad with clear roles in mind&mdash;we&rsquo;ve got batters who bring different strengths. I&rsquo;m just happy to contribute in whatever role is asked of me.Sure, it was nice to face a few more balls today, but I won&rsquo;t be asking any questions about my position&mdash;I trust the team&rsquo;s plans.The key tonight was building partnerships. It was a tricky surface, and we had to manage our risks carefully. I&rsquo;m pleased with how I played, but I&rsquo;ll feel even better enjoying a drink after a solid win.It&rsquo;s been a bit of a challenge this season&mdash;we&rsquo;ve encountered different conditions in almost every game. Tonight&rsquo;s pitch had been under the covers, and we haven&rsquo;t quite nailed it at home yet. That&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;ve got to acknowledge and improve upon.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n",

      "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for tonight&rsquo;s blockbuster at the Wankhede&mdash;Mumbai Indians versus Sunrisers Hyderabad. Both sides are neck and neck in the standings with just two wins apiece, and this clash isn&rsquo;t just another fixture&mdash;it&rsquo;s a battle for survival. Stakes are sky-high, and there&rsquo;s no room for error.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Mumbai Indians, led by Hardik Pandya, are feeling the heat. The Wankhede hasn&rsquo;t been the fortress it once was, and the pressure is piling up. All eyes will be on Jasprit Bumrah, who must deliver with the new ball, especially under the lights where the ball does a bit early on. Rohit Sharma at the top needs to anchor, and the middle order has to click&mdash;no excuses.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Sunrisers Hyderabad come in with their tails up after a record-breaking chase in their last outing. Abhishek Sharma&rsquo;s 141 off 55 balls was a showstopper, and Travis Head continues to be a menace up top. Add Heinrich Klaasen&rsquo;s brute power in the middle, and you&rsquo;ve got a batting unit that can decimate any attack on its day.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Historically, MI leads SRH 13-10, but past records mean little tonight. Expect fireworks, strategic masterstrokes, and a contest that could redefine both teams&#39; seasons. This is the IPL at its finest&mdash;edge-of-the-seat action awaits.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (27)_1744895812.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\nIPL Stats at Wankhede Stadium Since 2024:<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 - 2025-04-17T185024_1744896089.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report | Murali Kartik &amp; Michael Clarke<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&quot;I&rsquo;m standing here at the South end of the stadium, and let&rsquo;s take a look at the dimensions. It&rsquo;s 60 meters to my right, 67 to the left, and straight down the ground is 73 meters.We&rsquo;re on <strong>Pitch Number 6<\/strong>, which traditionally has seen low scores&mdash;but let&rsquo;s not dwell on history. What matters is what&rsquo;s on offer today. I&rsquo;m told the surface was watered this morning, and with the sun beating down, it still feels a bit damp. There&rsquo;s definitely some moisture underneath.It actually looks like a really good pitch. Yes, there&rsquo;s a bit of moisture as Kartik mentioned, but there&rsquo;s also a nice grass cover, which should provide consistency.One end does look drier, so we might see some <strong>turn for the spinners<\/strong>. But overall, I think it&rsquo;s going to play beautifully.I&rsquo;d expect both teams to <strong>prefer chasing<\/strong>, given the conditions. Doesn&rsquo;t seem like there will be much dew tonight, so that shouldn&rsquo;t be a factor.I certainly hope so, buddy! Looks like a good cricket wicket. Should offer something for everyone&mdash;<strong>early movement for the quicks<\/strong>, <strong>grip for the spinners<\/strong>, and once batters get in, it could be great to watch.&quot;It&rsquo;s a red-soil surface, so yes, that should definitely help the spinners as the game progresses.

We were probably a few runs short&mdash;would&rsquo;ve liked to get a bit more on the board. You usually expect this surface to be fast and fluent, but it just didn&rsquo;t play that way.Credit to the opposition&mdash;they bowled really well and managed to shut down a lot of our strong hitting zones. We felt we had most of our bases covered, but with 160, you always feel just a little under par.With the ball, we gave it a good crack. We knew we needed wickets early. We had plenty of death bowling options, and that&rsquo;s why we brought Rahul in as the Impact Player&mdash;to give us that flexibility with 1-2 overs if needed.To make the final, you&#39;ve got to play well away from home, and unfortunately, things haven&rsquo;t quite clicked for us on the road this season. We&rsquo;ve got a short break now, and then we regroup.We speak about assessing conditions every game, and I thought the boys did a good job getting through the powerplay without reckless hitting.Next one&rsquo;s at home&mdash;we know that venue really well, and we&rsquo;re looking forward to bouncing back there.&quot;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Hardik Pandya | Mumbai Indians Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;The way we bowled today was smart and spot on. We stuck to our basics, kept things simple, and quickly figured out which deliveries were tough to hit. That&rsquo;s where we managed to squeeze them and control the game.<br \/>\nIt looked like a decent track with a bit of grass. Deepak bowled a few deliveries that held up a little, so we sensed that change of pace could be effective. We tried to mix it up&mdash;not just slower ones, because if you bowl them too often, batters can line you up. We balanced it well with yorkers too, which disrupted their rhythm.<br \/>\nThat&rsquo;s the beauty of someone like Will. He brings all three facets to the table&mdash;brilliant in the field, delivers those handy overs, and with the bat, he&rsquo;s explosive. That&rsquo;s exactly why we back him&mdash;he&rsquo;s a complete package.<br \/>\nAt one point, when we needed 42 off 42, it felt like a tricky phase. We didn&rsquo;t want to get carried away and lose a couple of wickets in excitement. So we consciously took a couple of overs to settle in. We knew the boundaries would come, and once we absorbed that pressure, we were able to press the accelerator at the right time.It&rsquo;s going to be a packed house, no doubt. We&rsquo;re expecting a great atmosphere and a high-quality game. For now, it&#39;s about resting well and coming back fresh to go again.&quot;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Will Jacks | Player of the Match:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;Yeah, it&rsquo;s been a slow start&mdash;not just for me personally, but for the team as well. Honestly, it&rsquo;s been incredibly frustrating at times. Even tonight, I didn&rsquo;t begin well&mdash;dropped a catch on the first ball. It came at me with pace, and I was just a bit late to react. Still, no excuses&mdash;I should&rsquo;ve taken it. Glad I could pull things back later in the game.It&rsquo;s taken me a little while to settle into the new franchise, but I&rsquo;m feeling comfortable and confident now. It&rsquo;s a great setup with plenty of star players around to learn from, and I&rsquo;m just trying to absorb as much as I can. We&rsquo;re starting to click as a team, and this was a brilliant win tonight. Hopefully, we can keep the momentum going.&#39;Playable&#39; is a good word for how I see myself. I&rsquo;m always ready to do whatever&rsquo;s required for the team&mdash;whether that means batting at 7 or bowling a few overs. As long as there&rsquo;s clear communication about my role, I&rsquo;m happy to adapt. At the end of the day, if the team&rsquo;s winning, that&rsquo;s all that matters to me.On this pitch, if you&rsquo;re bowling slower balls, you have to bowl them into the wicket&mdash;it&rsquo;s what the surface demanded.I&rsquo;ve also been working hard on being more aggressive against spin, and I&rsquo;ll continue to build on that aspect of my game.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n",

      "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>Ladies and gentlemen, get ready for a blockbuster showdown tonight as the Delhi Capitals take on the Rajasthan Royals at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in the heart of the capital. This is match number 32 of the IPL 2025 season, and it&#39;s shaping up to be a cracker.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The Capitals have been in scintillating form this season, with their top order firing on all cylinders. Their bowlers have been equally impressive, keeping the opposition in check with disciplined performances. A win tonight could see them climb to the top of the points table, a testament to their consistency and hunger for success.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>On the other hand, the Royals have had a turbulent journey so far, managing only two wins from their six outings. Their batting lineup has struggled to find rhythm, and their bowlers have been unable to apply sustained pressure. However, the Royals are known for their resilience, and a victory tonight could be the spark they need to turn their season around.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The Arun Jaitley Stadium is known for its high-scoring encounters, and with both teams boasting explosive batsmen, we can expect a run-fest under the lights. The pitch will likely favour the batsmen, but the bowlers who can adapt quickly and execute their plans will be the ones to watch.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>As the sun sets over Delhi, the stage is set for an enthralling contest between two teams with contrasting fortunes. Will the Capitals continue their march towards the playoffs, or will the Royals script a comeback for the ages? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain &ndash; we&#39;re in for a thrilling ride tonight!<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (26)_1744809642.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/>&nbsp;<\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report &ndash; Graeme Swann &amp; Shane Watson<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&quot;We&rsquo;re here at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi&mdash;an gorgeous venue to play cricket. But let&rsquo;s be honest, it&rsquo;s not the biggest place for bowlers to enjoy! The boundaries are short&mdash;61 meters to my right, 62 to the left, and 72 straight down the ground. Not exactly a comforting sight for the bowlers&mdash;you can feel the pressure with these dimensions. The surface is a little dry again, similar to the previous match. There&rsquo;s a good amount of grass cover on top, but it&rsquo;s patchy in parts, which means it&rsquo;ll offer something for the bowlers too. While batting first has worked well here&mdash;last season&rsquo;s average winning first-innings score was around 230&mdash;this pitch still offers some grip for the spinners and some assistance for pacers who vary their pace. All in all, it&rsquo;s a well-balanced pitch. Batters will fancy their chances, especially with the small boundaries, but bowlers who hit the right areas and mix things up will get rewards too. Given the setup, we&rsquo;re in for a great contest!&quot;<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (40)_1744811737.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE:<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Won The Toss And Elected To Field<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

This match had everything&mdash;early fireworks, momentum shifts, heartbreaks, and a finish for the ages.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Rajasthan, chasing 189, started with a bang through Jaiswal and Samson, who raced to 61\/0. But the tide turned when Sanju Samson walked off injured with a suspected side strain. Nitish Rana tried to take the innings deep with a crisp 51(28), but DC&rsquo;s bowlers kept chipping away. The final over from Mitchell Starc was a masterclass, defending nine runs with two pinpoint yorkers and two run-outs.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Earlier, Axar Patel&rsquo;s 34(14) and <em><em>Stubbs&#39; 34<\/em>(18)<\/em>* helped DC reach 188 after a middle-overs stutter. In reply, RR matched that exactly, taking it to the Super Over. But that&rsquo;s when Stubbs smashed Sandeep Sharma for a match-winning six to seal the deal.&nbsp;<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/Match 32_1744830844.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Sanju Samson | Rajasthan Royals Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;The injury feels alright now. I just wasn&rsquo;t ready to come back out and bat at the time, but we&rsquo;ll assess it tomorrow and see how it goes.I thought we bowled really well overall. There were moments when they came at us hard, but credit to our bowlers&mdash;we showed great energy in the field.That target was definitely within reach considering the batting lineup we have. But full credit to Starcy&mdash;he&rsquo;s one of the best in the world. The way he bowled the 20th over, he won them the game.The plan was simple: swing hard. We knew he&rsquo;d come at us, and we had to respond with intent.Sandeep Sharma has been my go-to in the toughest phases&mdash;powerplay, the 18th, the 20th. He&rsquo;s delivered time and again. Archer bowled well too. But Starc simply took the game away in those final moments.A win tonight could&rsquo;ve really lifted spirits in the dressing room, but we need to keep moving forward.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Axar Patel | Delhi Capitals Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;We started well, but I felt we could&rsquo;ve shown a bit more intent through the middle. The pitch wasn&rsquo;t easy&mdash;the batters mentioned that&mdash;and I told them to keep the intent high regardless.The ball was sticking slightly. Set batters found it manageable, but it was tough for new batters to come in and score freely. That&rsquo;s why I called for the Strategic Time-Out, just to reset and remind everyone that boundaries wouldn&rsquo;t come easy. We adjusted our plans and you could see the difference.When a new batter comes in on such a pitch, the pressure builds&mdash;whether to rotate strike or go for the big hits.Personally, I had a minor finger injury from the Champions Trophy earlier this season. But as captain, I always want to contribute&mdash;today, it all came together with both bat and ball.I was confident that if Starc could execute, he&rsquo;d bring us back into the game&mdash;and he did just that. He nailed his yorkers in the 20th over and the Super Over. That&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s a legend of the game. His mentality is top-class.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Mitchell Starc | Player of the Match<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">&quot;For me, it&rsquo;s all about backing my execution. If you&rsquo;ve got a clear plan and stick to it, more often than not, things work out. A little bit of luck always helps too. It was a fantastic game, and I&rsquo;m glad we came out on the right side of it.I&rsquo;ve been around long enough that most people know what&rsquo;s coming from me. But execution is key. You play that over 10 different times, and you might get 10 different results. Fortunately, tonight, I executed well enough to take it to a Super Over.I was surprised they sent out left-handers&mdash;it suited the ball tailing into them. I got a couple of lucky breaks, especially with the wide line. But we&rsquo;ve got the batting depth to chase it down, and in the end, it was a solid win.It&rsquo;s a great mix of youth and experience. Axar&rsquo;s leading the side well. We&rsquo;ve got guys like Faf, KL, and Tristan who&rsquo;ve played plenty of cricket and bring a lot of calm. There&rsquo;s real talent in the squad and a lot of fun being had. Success always helps, and tonight&rsquo;s win should build great momentum going forward.&quot;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n",

      "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>Ladies and gentlemen, strap yourselves in &ndash; because tonight in Mullanpur, it&rsquo;s not just a match, it&rsquo;s a <em>blockbuster waiting to explode!<\/em> The Punjab Kings, still nursing wounds from a heartbreaking loss despite scoring 245 in their last outing, return to their fortress looking for redemption. Shreyas Iyer &ndash; calm, collected, and carrying a touch of vengeance &ndash; leads this Punjab side with fire in the belly, especially as he lines up against his old brigade, the Kolkata Knight Riders.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>On the other side, KKR walk in with their heads held high after a commanding win over CSK. Ajinkya Rahane&rsquo;s men are clicking into gear, with their spin twins &ndash; Sunil Narine and Varun Chakaravarthy &ndash; strangling oppositions like seasoned maestros. Narine, with 34 scalps against Punjab in his career, is a man on a mission.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>For Punjab, Iyer&rsquo;s strike rate of over 208 has been box-office, but the Kings need more from the likes of Glenn Maxwell, who&rsquo;s yet to light the stage. The pitch at Mullanpur has been a belter. 200+ is par, and the bowlers know they&rsquo;re entering a lion&rsquo;s den tonight.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>In 33 previous encounters, KKR lead 21-12, but history has little meaning when the stakes are this high. Both teams have the arsenal. Both are desperate for consistency. And when desperation meets talent under the lights &ndash; fireworks are guaranteed.<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (20)_1744723054.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/>&nbsp;<\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;Pitch Report |&nbsp; Danny Morrison &amp; Simon Katich<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&quot;Great to be back here! This ground always brings excitement, and there&rsquo;s definitely a bias in terms of dimensions. To my right, it&#39;s a solid 70 meters&mdash;that&#39;s a decent hit. But to my left, it shortens up to just 61 meters, and it&#39;s 75 meters straight down the ground.Now, time for some insight into the 22 yards itself.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s absolutely rock hard&mdash;really firm underfoot. That means the ball should come nicely onto the bat.This season, every time a team has batted first here, they&rsquo;ve crossed 200 and successfully defended it. So, the toss becomes very interesting tonight.What&rsquo;s also notable is that despite being at home, the Punjab Kings haven&rsquo;t had much success here. They&rsquo;ve played seven matches at this venue and have only managed two wins. It hasn&rsquo;t been a happy hunting ground&mdash;yet.That said, this is a new-look Punjab Kings side, and they&rsquo;ve got serious firepower with the bat. However, their powerplay bowling has been a concern&mdash;they haven&rsquo;t taken many early wickets this season.KKR&rsquo;s spinners will have a big role to play tonight, and with Lockie Ferguson ruled out due to injury, it&rsquo;ll be interesting to see how both teams approach their tactics.&quot;<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (39)_1744725750.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE: <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/PK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:54px\" title=\"\" \/><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Won The Toss And Elected To Bat<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

A fiery 30(15) from Prabhsimran and 22(12) from Priyansh Arya gave them a spark initially. Yet, it was the bowlers who wrote the fairytale ending. Marco Jansen (3\/17) was sensational with pace and bounce, while Yuzvendra Chahal turned the tide with a masterclass (4\/28), claiming the likes of Rahane, Raghuvanshi, Rinku and Ramandeep.KKR were cruising at 62\/2 but collapsed to 95 all out, losing 8 wickets for just 33 runs! Even the mighty Dre Russ couldn&rsquo;t rescue them, bowled by Jansen to seal a famous win.With every KKR batter falling to pressure, PBKS&rsquo; bowling unit showed immense character to pull off the lowest 20-over total defended in IPL history&nbsp;<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/Post31_1744739063.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Ajinkya Rahane | KKR Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>&quot;Nothing much to explain&mdash;everyone saw what happened. I&#39;m extremely disappointed with the performance. I&rsquo;ll take the blame&mdash;I played a poor shot. Even though it looked like it was missing, I wasn&rsquo;t sure enough to take the review. I had a quick chat with Angkrish, and he said it might be umpire&rsquo;s call, but I didn&rsquo;t want to take a chance at that point. That was our discussion, we weren&#39;t really thinking about NRR. We just batted poorly as a unit. There&#39;s no running away from that&mdash;we take full responsibility.Our bowlers did a great job, especially on this surface, to restrict a strong Punjab batting lineup to 111. From a batting point of view, on this wicket, playing with a straight bat was more effective. The sweep was hard to execute. Intent is important, yes, but we needed to play proper cricketing shots. We were reckless. Honestly, right now, a lot is going on in my head. It was an easy chase, and we let it slip. Once I go back to the dressing room, I need to calm down, collect my thoughts, and then speak to the boys. We still have half the tournament ahead of us. We need to stay positive, address our mistakes, and move forward with clarity.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Shreyas Iyer | PBKS Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;It&rsquo;s hard to put into words what just happened. The ball was turning, and I told Yuzi [Chahal] to really give it a rip&mdash;we wanted to stay aggressive, and thankfully, the right players stood up at the right time.These kinds of wins&mdash;tough, gritty ones&mdash;they give you momentum down the line.When I went out to bat, a couple of deliveries behaved strangely&mdash;one stayed low, one kicked up from the bottom. Even the batters who are good at sweeping were struggling, which told us there was variable bounce.That awareness helped. We asked our bowlers to keep the stumps in play and let the pitch do the work.Those two quick wickets early in the second innings shifted the momentum our way. And once Yuzi started spinning it big, belief started growing. We kept attacking fields, backed our bowlers, and forced them to take risks.It&rsquo;s important to stay humble after a win like this. We&rsquo;ll take the confidence from it, build on the momentum, and focus on improving in the games to come.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Yuzvendra Chahal | Player of the Match:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;It was a total team effort. We stayed positive and believed that if we could pick up 2&ndash;3 wickets in the powerplay, we&rsquo;d put the opposition under real pressure.The pitch was on the slower side, and it was offering turn&mdash;which worked in our favourWhen I bowled my first delivery and saw it turn, Shreyas immediately asked if I wanted a slip. I didn&rsquo;t hesitate&mdash;I asked for it straightaway. The mindset was clear: we were going for wickets to win the game.I went for 56 runs in the last match, but I had the confidence to bounce back. I believed I could change the game in the middle overs, and that self-belief made the difference today.My approach is always to aim for a wicket from the very first ball. Against Ajju bhai (Ajinkya Rahane), I mixed up my pace deliberately&mdash;to make it harder for him to go after me.Winning low-scoring games like this really lifts the team&rsquo;s morale. These are the kind of gritty wins that bring everyone together.And on a personal note&mdash;it feels special. This is my first Player of the Match award for Punjab, and I&rsquo;m really happy it came in such a memorable game.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n",

      "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>The Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium sets the stage for a high-stakes showdown as Lucknow Super Giants host Chennai Super Kings in a battle of contrasting campaigns. LSG, brimming with confidence, sit comfortably in the top four with four wins from six games. Their success has been built on team depth and individual brilliance&mdash;Nicholas Pooran&#39;s five fifties in six matches underline their batting firepower, while Shardul Thakur has stepped up with the ball, becoming the tournament&rsquo;s second-highest wicket-taker.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>In stark contrast, CSK are grappling with one of their most forgettable seasons. Just one win in six matches and a faltering batting unit&mdash;highlighted by Rachin Ravindra&#39;s modest 149-run tally&mdash;have left them languishing at the bottom. The return of MS Dhoni to captaincy hasn&#39;t reversed their fortunes, and despite Noor Ahmad&rsquo;s Purple Cap-worthy performance (12 wickets), their famed spin attack has largely underwhelmed.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>LSG have won three of their last five encounters against CSK and will look to extend that dominance on home turf. With both pride and playoff hopes on the line for CSK, and LSG eyeing consolidation, expect fireworks in this must-watch clash between the Super Giants and the Super Kings.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (25)_1744640196.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report | Daren Ganga &amp; Michael Clarke:<\/strong><br \/>\n&quot;The Ekana Stadium lights up tonight to host Match 30&mdash;a crucial contest for both sides. CSK will be desperate to snap their five-match losing streak.We&rsquo;re on Pitch Number 5 today, positioned right in the center of the square. The boundary dimensions are fairly balanced&mdash;66 meters on either side and 73 meters straight down the ground. Behind the stumps, it&#39;s slightly shorter at 59 meters, something the batters will definitely keep in mind.The curator tells us this is a hybrid pitch&mdash;about 70% black soil and 30% red. Historically, teams haven&rsquo;t crossed the 200-run mark too often here.The wicket looks promising, but I suspect it might play a little two-paced&mdash;that&rsquo;s probably due to the blend of black and red soil. You can see some inconsistencies in the surface, and that could make strokeplay a bit tricky.It reminds me a bit of the Hyderabad wicket&mdash;there are some grass patches here as well. As the game progresses, pace variations from the fast bowlers will be key. Slower balls and cutters could be very effective today.With conditions like these, both teams will be aiming to adapt quickly and grab those all-important two points.&quot;<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (18)_1744639093.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS UPDATE: <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/CSK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:43px\" title=\"\" \/><span style=\"color:#d35400\">Won The Toss And Elected To Field<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

Chasing 167, CSK&rsquo;s revamped opening pair of Shaik Rasheed and Rachin Ravindra provided a much-needed solid start, adding 52 runs in the Powerplay. While Rasheed impressed on debut with a fluent 27, Ravindra top-scored with 37, showing early aggression.A middle-overs slowdown, triggered by the spin trio of Ravi Bishnoi, Aiden Markram, and Digvesh Singh, put CSK under pressure, reducing them to 111\/5. However, Shivam Dube (43* off 37) and MS Dhoni (26* off 11) steadied the ship and expertly finished the chase.Earlier, Rishabh Pant anchored the LSG innings with a well-crafted 63 off 49. Cameos from Mitchell Marsh, Ayush Badoni, and Abdul Samad pushed LSG to 166\/7. CSK&rsquo;s bowling unit, led by Ravindra Jadeja (2\/24) and Matheesha Pathirana (2\/45), maintained control despite occasional bursts of momentum from LSG.With this result, CSK not only claim two points but also rebuild momentum heading into the second half of the season.<\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/image - 2025-04-15T002135_1744656718.png\" \/><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Rishabh Pant | LSG Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;We feel we were about 10&ndash;15 runs short today. We kept losing wickets at key moments&mdash;every time we had some momentum, we lost a wicket and couldn&rsquo;t build a strong partnership.The wicket was decent to bat on, though slightly tricky at times. I still feel we could&rsquo;ve added 10 more runs to the total.<br \/>\nI&rsquo;m feeling better with each game. Sometimes, even when you&#39;re hitting the ball well, it just doesn&rsquo;t come off. For me, it&rsquo;s about finding rhythm and taking things one game at a time.We had time to think about the options. The plan was to take it deep, but it just didn&rsquo;t go our way in the end.Our powerplay bowling has been a bit of a concern&mdash;something we&rsquo;re looking to sort out as the tournament progresses. But credit to the bowlers, they pulled things back really well in the middle overs.As a team, we&rsquo;re focused on staying positive and continuing to improve with each game.&quot;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>MS Dhoni | CSK Captain &amp; Player of the Match:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>&quot;It&rsquo;s always good to win&mdash;especially in a tournament like this. Things haven&rsquo;t quite gone our way lately, but a win like this gives us a lot of confidence. It was a tough game, but I&rsquo;m glad we ended up on the winning side.In the powerplay, we struggled a bit to find rhythm with the ball. But the middle overs were solid, and we finished strongly at the death. That&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;ve been able to do well&mdash;bounce back even when the opposition gets a good start, and pull things back to keep them to a par score.We haven&rsquo;t been getting the kind of starts we&rsquo;re looking for as a batting unit, and the frequent fall of wickets has been concerning. One factor could be the nature of the Chennai pitches&mdash;they&rsquo;ve been a bit on the slower side. Interestingly, our batting performances have been better away from home. As a group, it&rsquo;s important that we keep expressing ourselves.At the moment, our bowling unit is doing better than our batting. We&rsquo;ve made a few changes to the attack&mdash;we needed bowlers who could deliver in the powerplay. Earlier, we were putting too much pressure on Ash, having him bowl two overs up front. This new setup gives us more balance, and I believe this attack is more effective overall.That said, the batting still needs improvement. We&#39;re losing wickets at crucial times, so we need someone to play the anchoring role. We&rsquo;ve trained for that, and it&rsquo;s important for everyone to execute their roles consistently.I thought he batted really well today. He&rsquo;s been with us for a while&mdash;last year he showed promise, and this season he&rsquo;s looked very good in the nets. What sets him apart is that he plays authentic cricket shots&mdash;he doesn&rsquo;t just slog. He has the potential to dominate in a classy way.Honestly, even I was surprised when I got the award! I thought Noor bowled brilliantly today. Our new-ball bowlers also did a fantastic job. But I&rsquo;ll take it with a smile.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n",

Karn Sharma (3\/36) and Mitchell Santner (2\/43) triggered the collapse.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>But it was the penultimate over that defined the drama &mdash; three run-outs in three balls, courtesy of MI&#39;s sharp fielding and DC&#39;s poor running between the wickets, sealed the deal for the visitors.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>With this win, Mumbai Indians climb up the table, while Delhi Capitals are left pondering missed opportunities and what could&rsquo;ve been.&nbsp;<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/Post29_1744569030.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Axar Patel | DC Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>We actually had the game in our hands. But I think a few soft dismissals from the middle order and some poor shot selections cost us. Losing by just 12 runs with an over to spare&mdash;it was still within reach.You can&rsquo;t always rely on the lower order to pull off chases. There&rsquo;ll be days when shots don&rsquo;t come off, and that&#39;s fine&mdash;no point overthinking it.I thought 205 was a very chaseable target. The pitch was good and there was dew settling in too. Maybe if we&rsquo;d fielded a bit better and held onto our catches, we could&rsquo;ve restricted them to a few less.On the bowling front, I have a lot of confidence in our spin trio. Two of them can bowl in the powerplay, and Kuldeep&mdash;he&rsquo;s been unbelievable this season. Whenever we need a breakthrough, I know I can count on him.There were a lot of positives to take from this game. We just need to move on and not dwell on it.&quot;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Hardik Pandya | MI Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;Absolutely&mdash;winning always feels special, especially in games like this where you&rsquo;re unsure until the 13th over about which way it&rsquo;ll swing.We were running out of options with the way he was batting. He took his chances and showed the kind of hard work he&#39;s put in over the years. To come in and go like that&mdash;credit to him.Outstanding from Karn. Bowling in a stadium with short boundaries isn&rsquo;t easy, but he showed great heart. He kept tossing it up, stayed brave, and really showed his character tonight.I&rsquo;ve always believed fielding can completely flip a game. Tonight, we were sharp&mdash;backing each other up, staying switched on. And that made a huge difference.It&rsquo;s always situation-dependent. We want to give more time in the middle to players who are in form. With the heavy dew, it was a bit tricky. We&rsquo;ll continue to assess and adapt the order based on conditions.One thing we keep reminding ourselves: the game isn&rsquo;t over until it&rsquo;s actually over. As long as we show character and fight for every moment, momentum can swing our way. Tonight was proof of that.&quot;<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Karn Sharma |&nbsp;Player of the Match<\/strong><strong>:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;It&rsquo;s a great feeling. I&rsquo;ve always trusted my process, and it feels really good when the hard work starts paying off.Whenever I get a chance, I just want to make the most of it. Whether I&rsquo;m in the playing XI or not, I keep working hard. At the end of the day, only 11 or 12 players can make it into the game&mdash;it&rsquo;s all about team combination.I think KL Rahul&rsquo;s wicket was the turning point for us. That catch came at a crucial moment. I always pray a lot&mdash;for wins, for moments like these.We also changed the ball, which helped us. With the dew coming in, the fresh ball was a bit drier, making it easier to grip. That made a difference in the end.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n",

      "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>The Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur is ready to welcome its first match of the TATA IPL 2025 season as Rajasthan Royals (RR) take on Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) in Match 28. With both sides coming off losses in their previous fixtures, this encounter carries extra weight as teams jostle for mid-table positioning.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>RR have managed two wins from five matches, and while their batting has shown promise, it&rsquo;s been a bit topsy-turvy &mdash; moments of brilliance have been followed by untimely collapses. The return to rhythm for Jofra Archer has been a big positive, with the speedster bowling with great control and pace. Maheesh Theekshana has been among the wickets and has kept the run flow in check during the middle overs. Playing their first match at home this season, RR will hope for a strong all-round show to capitalise on familiar conditions.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>RCB, on the other hand, have three wins from five games &mdash; all secured on the road. Their batting has largely been powered by Phil Salt, Rajat Patidar, and Virat Kohli, who&rsquo;ve handled the bulk of the scoring. However, they&rsquo;ll be eager for more support from the rest of the line-up to deliver a well-rounded performance. The availability of Wanindu Hasaranga remains uncertain due to personal reasons, which could leave a gap in their spin attack.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>With both teams aiming to bounce back and Jaipur finally getting into the IPL action, fans can expect an intense battle in the pink city.&nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (20)_1744536658.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\nIPL Stats At Sawai Mansingh Stadium Since 2024:<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 - 2025-04-13T151131_1744537395.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report &ndash; Deep Dasgupta &amp; Varun Aaron<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&quot;We&rsquo;re here for the first game of the season in Jaipur&mdash;and it&rsquo;s a hot afternoon, really intense out here, though there&#39;s a bit of breeze. Now, let&rsquo;s talk dimensions. It&rsquo;s one of the larger venues in the country&mdash;62 meters on one side, 69 meters on the other, and straight down the ground it&rsquo;s 74 meters. This looks like a really good wicket. Last year, we saw two games played here&mdash;one of them also an afternoon clash&mdash;and both went 190-plus. This ground has a solid batting history. Virat Kohli got a century here last season. Sanju Samson has racked up 150 runs at this venue without getting dismissed. Riyan Parag averages 60 here&mdash;it&rsquo;s been a happy hunting ground for batters. Now, if we take a closer look, there are a few cracks on the surface but also some grass&mdash;not live grass, more like dead grass to bind the pitch. Overall, it looks like a flat batting deck. It might offer a bit to the spinners later in the second innings, but for the most part, it&rsquo;s set up for runs. Expecting a high-scoring game; there could be some turn on offer later. So, would you prefer to bat first or chase here? Historically, teams batting first have had better results on this pitch. But to be honest, this wicket is good enough either way. It&rsquo;ll all come down to which team plays better cricket today.&quot;<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (37)_1744537425.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS UPDATE:<\/strong>&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/RCB-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" \/><span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>Won The Toss And Elected To Field<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

Chasing 174 for victory, RCB&#39;s top-order blazed through the target in just 17.3 overs, with Phil Salt and Virat Kohli leading the charge.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Salt set the tone early, racing to 65 off just 33 balls with 5 fours and 6 sixes, dominating the Powerplay with ruthless intent. Though he fell to Kumar Kartikeya at 92, the momentum never dipped. Kohli, composed and calculated, anchored the chase with an unbeaten 62 off 45, while Devdutt Padikkal (40* off 28) applied the finishing touches with a flurry of boundaries. Earlier, Yashasvi Jaiswal&rsquo;s fluent 75 powered Rajasthan to 173\/4. Despite a strong start, the Royals lost their way in the middle overs. Krunal Pandya was economical (1\/29), and Josh Hazlewood (1\/26) removed the set Jaiswal at a crucial moment.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>RCB&rsquo;s commanding performance underlines their title credentials, now sitting third on the table.

It wasn&rsquo;t easy batting in the powerplay&mdash;we struggled, and we knew Salt and Kohli would come hard. Honestly, they won the game right there in the first six overs.Both sides missed chances&mdash;we dropped theirs, they dropped ours. But in the end, they simply batted better. Credit where it&rsquo;s due&mdash;RCB showed more intent, and I have to admit, the toss did play a part.Ideally, I would&rsquo;ve liked to take the game deeper, into the 19th or 20th over.The good thing is the dressing room is honest. Everyone acknowledges where we went wrong. The mindset is still positive&mdash;we&rsquo;ve had a great season, and we need to leave this behind, bounce back fresh, and stay confident heading into the next one.It&#39;s all about moving on quickly and staying focused.&quot;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Rajat Patidar | RCB Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong><span style=\"color:#16a085\">&quot;It was an incredible performance. The bowlers really nailed their plans&mdash;it was great to watch.We didn&rsquo;t have a fixed number in mind, but given how the pitch was behaving, especially in the powerplay, we thought 150&ndash;170 would be competitive.I draw a lot of confidence from them. They&rsquo;re ready to bowl in any conditions, at any stage of the game.I really enjoyed Salt&rsquo;s knock&mdash;it was something special. And the way VK bhai rotated the strike&mdash;it made a big difference.We don&rsquo;t focus too much on the venue. Our mindset is to play positive cricket, wherever we go.&quot;&nbsp;<\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\nPhil Salt | Player of the Match:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>&quot;Yeah, I&rsquo;m really pleased with my performance&mdash;especially doing it away from home. This venue was a bit unfamiliar to me, and before the game, I&rsquo;d said I wanted to give the team a solid start. Happy to have done exactly that today.I had a few plans in mind, but he was swinging the ball quite a bit. So I picked a particular area on the ground to target. Me and Jofra go way back&mdash;we&rsquo;ve had a lot of battles in the nets. Honestly, he&rsquo;s knocked me over more than anyone else. I&rsquo;ve probably faced him the most. Feels nice to have one over him today. But we&rsquo;ll be up against each other again in a few days.The wicket was a touch slower and lower. The powerplay gave me a chance to really make an impact. To be fair, Rajasthan batted well too. But our bowlers stuck to the plans and made them hit straight&mdash;exactly where we wanted. Overall, just a great team performance.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n",

      "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up! Tonight at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, Hyderabad, it&#39;s a high-voltage clash between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Punjab Kings.Sunrisers Hyderabad, led by Pat Cummins, are in a bit of a pickle, having lost four on the trot. Their explosive start to the season has fizzled out, with the top order misfiring and the bowlers leaking runs. The likes of Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma need to rediscover their mojo, and fast.On the flip side, Punjab Kings are flying high. Shreyas Iyer&#39;s men have won three out of four, with young guns like Priyansh Arya stepping up big time. Their bowling attack, featuring Arshdeep Singh and Yuzvendra Chahal, has been spot on.The pitch at Hyderabad is a belter, offering something for everyone. Expect a run-fest, with both teams looking to outgun each other.<br \/>\nSo, who will rise and who will fall? Will SRH break their losing streak, or will PBKS continue their winning ways? It&#39;s all to play for, and it&#39;s going to be a cracker of a contest!<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (18)_1744460757.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/>&nbsp;<\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report | Pommie Mbangwa &amp; Michael Clarke<\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;Square boundaries: 63m and 69m. Down the ground? A solid 77 meters.This is an absolute dream for the batters. Flat, hard, true surface. The only patch of green is behind the stumps. Expect the ball to come on nicely, and with the short square side, I&rsquo;d say 230 to 240 is your par score tonight.That&#39;s big talk, but fair. This is pitch number two and historically, the average score here is 211 &ndash; but as we&#39;ve seen, that&#39;s rarely enough to defend.Spot on. And here&#39;s the kicker &ndash; no dew expected tonight. So both captains have a fair shot, regardless of the toss. If you win it though &ndash; you <em>bat first<\/em> and bat big.&quot;&nbsp;<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (36)_1744467473.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE:<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/PK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:54px\" title=\"\" \/><\/strong> <span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Won The Toss And Elected To Bat<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

Despite Harshal Patel&rsquo;s four-wicket haul, SRH&rsquo;s top order responded with brute force.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Abhishek Sharma delivered an innings of a lifetime, hammering a blistering 141 off just 55 balls, laced with 14 fours and 10 sixes, making it the highest individual score of IPL 2024. Travis Head&rsquo;s 66 off 37 provided the perfect platform, and the duo&rsquo;s 171-run opening stand left PBKS shell-shocked.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>SRH sealed the chase with 9 balls to spare, Heinrich Klaasen applying the finishing touches. It was a night that will be remembered for Abhishek&rsquo;s carnage, and for rewriting the record books under the lights of Uppal.&nbsp;<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/Post_27_1744482219.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Shreyas Iyer | PBKS Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;It was a fantastic total, but honestly, I can&rsquo;t help but laugh at how they chased it down with two overs to spare.We could&rsquo;ve taken those two catches&mdash;those were key moments. He was lucky, yes, but it was an out-of-this-world knock. To sum it up, our bowling didn&#39;t meet expectations. We&rsquo;ll need to go back to the drawing board and figure out how to bring out our best.I did give him credit&mdash;the way he struck the ball was incredible. The opening partnership left us with hardly any opportunities. I&rsquo;ll admit, the over rotation on my part could&rsquo;ve been better.That was a big blow. He&rsquo;s someone who delivers 140+ consistently and picks up crucial wickets. But injuries are part of the game. No excuses though&mdash;we have other bowlers capable of winning matches.To be honest, we felt 230 would&rsquo;ve been a good score. The pitch was gripping initially, but once the dew set in, batting got easier. Still, the way they batted&mdash;it&rsquo;s one of the best knocks I&rsquo;ve ever seen.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pat Cummins | SRH Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>&quot;Please, not these pitches in Australia for Test matches!As a bowling unit, we knew what we were walking into&mdash;it suits our style. But credit to the batters, they really showed what they&rsquo;re capable of.Honestly, not many options here. Slower balls don&rsquo;t stick&mdash;the ball just flies off the surface. Anything under 10 an over is a win.Chasing 250... they&#39;ve done this before. It&rsquo;s crazy, but they made it look possible.I&rsquo;m a big fan of Abhi. We didn&rsquo;t want to overthink, just stick to what makes us good players. That&rsquo;s the strength of this squad&mdash;keeping it simple.The crowd was phenomenal&mdash;flags waving, packed stands. The support&rsquo;s been awesome.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Abhishek Sharma | Player of the Match:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>&quot;It hasn&rsquo;t been easy going through a rough patch. But a special thanks to the team and captain&mdash;they kept things simple for us batters, even when I wasn&rsquo;t doing well.I had a good chat with Travis before the game&mdash;it was a special day for both of us. I usually don&rsquo;t play too much behind the wicket, but on this pitch, I tried inventing some shots due to the bounce and dimensions.The whole team&rsquo;s waiting for my parents&mdash;they&rsquo;ve been lucky charms for the Orange Army.We didn&rsquo;t over-complicate things; we just wanted to express ourselves and play naturally.This knock is very close to my heart. I badly wanted to break that losing streak. It was tough as a young player, but the team environment was so positive.Special thanks to Yuvi paaji&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been speaking to him regularly. And to Suryakumar Yadav as well&mdash;he&rsquo;s been a big support throughout.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n",

      "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>The Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow will host a high-stakes afternoon clash as Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) take on Gujarat Titans (GT) in Match 26 of the TATA IPL 2025. With both teams in solid form, this daytime encounter promises to be a compelling watch.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Gujarat Titans, currently sitting at the top of the points table, are riding a wave of momentum. After a narrow defeat to Punjab Kings in their opener, they&rsquo;ve bounced back emphatically with four consecutive wins. Their batting unit is firing on all cylinders &mdash; Jos Buttler has been providing brisk starts, while Sai Sudharsan has anchored the middle order with remarkable consistency. The real X-factor for GT, though, has been R Sai Kishore. The left-arm spinner has been exceptional, tying up batters with tight lines and picking up crucial wickets, particularly through the middle overs.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lucknow Super Giants, placed sixth, have three wins from five matches. Nicholas Pooran has been in stellar form with the bat, finishing games with authority. Support from Mitchell Marsh and Aiden Markram has strengthened the middle order, giving LSG a well-rounded batting unit. With the match being played in familiar home conditions, LSG will look to bring their A-game and challenge Gujarat&rsquo;s winning streak.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The pitch at Ekana is expected to assist slower bowlers, making this a tactical battle between two smartly built sides. A lot will depend on how both teams adapt during the afternoon heat and handle the slow, gripping surface.<\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (17)_1744449389.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report |&nbsp; Shane Watson &amp; Murali Kartik<\/strong><br \/>\n&ldquo;We&rsquo;re on Pitch No. 6 today, which has already seen runs galore. The black soil base and those big square boundaries&mdash;63m one side, 70m the other&mdash;should favor batters. Strangely enough, bowlers haven&rsquo;t really enjoyed the help they might expect from such dimensions.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a good-looking strip with a healthy grass cover and a bit of shine. In the previous outing, LSG put up 203 here. The surface has enough bounce to allow pacers to dig it in short and extract something with change-ups. Five of the ten wickets last time came off balls that hit the deck.&ldquo;This could be another high-scoring afternoon. With teams now finding success defending totals, the smart call might just be to win the toss and bat first.&rdquo;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (17)_1744451740.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Venue Stats Since TATA IPL 2024&nbsp;<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (8)_1744451777.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE:<\/strong>&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/LSG-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" \/><span style=\"color:#000099\"><strong>Won The Toss And Elected To Field<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

Chasing 181, the hosts were cool and calculated, with Aiden Markram&rsquo;s classy 58 and Nicholas Pooran&rsquo;s brutal 61 off 34 powering them past the finish line. Despite GT&#39;s late breakthroughs, Ayush Badoni and Abdul Samad held their nerve, finishing the game with poise under pressure.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Earlier, Gujarat looked set for a 200-plus total as Gill and Sudharsan stitched a 120-run opening stand, both notching fifties. But Avesh Khan&rsquo;s breakthrough of Gill shifted the tide.

Our plan was to take it to 18 overs, have someone bat through 50&ndash;60 balls once set, and aim for a total around 200&ndash;220.Losing back-to-back wickets really set us back. It was tough for any batter to get going initially, with the ball stopping a bit. Our strike rotation in the middle overs wasn&rsquo;t up to the mark, and that&rsquo;s something we need to improve.We were always aiming for wickets &mdash; that was the mindset. Yes, we were behind, but we believed that if we could pick 2&ndash;3 quick wickets, we could still push the game deep. And we did just that. We got breakthroughs after the 10th over, but the ball didn&rsquo;t hold up as much as we expected in the end, especially with some dew coming in during the final phase.Still, fighting till the end was a good sign. That&rsquo;s what we discussed during the second timeout &mdash; to stretch it as deep as we could. Thank you, everyone.&quot;<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Rishabh Pant | Lucknow Super Giants Captain<br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#000099\">&quot;Definitely feeling happy. We&rsquo;re sticking to the process, backing each other&rsquo;s abilities, and focusing on one match at a time.The plan was to bowl yorkers and attack the stumps &mdash; the bowlers executed that brilliantly, which was great to see as captain.To be honest, I wasn&rsquo;t too pleased with how things started, but it&rsquo;s a T20 game &mdash; pressure moments are part of it. The way the boys pulled it back was fantastic.With each game, I&rsquo;m feeling more confident. Marsh gave me a chance today, and I felt that spending more time at the crease would help me. It&#39;s about finding that rhythm. At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s a team game &mdash; we all want to contribute and help the team win.One thing&rsquo;s for sure &mdash; we&rsquo;re lucky to have Nicholas Pooran on our side. He&rsquo;s been outstanding with the bat. It&rsquo;s definitely better to have him in your team than to bowl to him!&quot;<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Aiden Markram | Player of the Match&nbsp;<br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#000099\">&quot;Yeah, definitely a slow surface. You want to start the tournament strong. My role has slightly changed, so it&#39;s been about adapting. The first few games didn&rsquo;t go my way, but I&rsquo;m grateful that things have improved in the last couple of knocks.It&rsquo;s probably a mix of things &mdash; tight schedules and ever-changing conditions. Some players can clear the ropes at will; that might not be my main strength, so I just try to stick to what works for me.Early in the tournament, I felt I had to change my game to match others in terms of hitting boundaries. But I realized it&#39;s better to play to your strengths if it helps the team.Conditions did shift. Under the hot sun, it was slow and tricky, but under lights, it played better. If we play another day game, we&rsquo;ll keep that in mind. Building partnerships will be key, especially since batting gets easier later on.&quot;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n",

After winning the toss and opting to bowl first, KKR&rsquo;s spinners completely dismantled CSK&rsquo;s batting unit on a sluggish surface.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>CSK were restricted to just 103\/9 in their 20 overs &mdash; a total that never truly challenged the visitors. Shivam Dube top-scored with 31 off 29, while Vijay Shankar chipped in with 29 runs. The rest of the batting faltered badly against disciplined spells from Sunil Narine (3\/13), Varun Chakaravarthy (2\/22), and Harshit Rana (2\/16). The hosts collapsed in clusters, losing wickets at regular intervals and failing to find any rhythm throughout the innings.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>In reply, KKR made short work of the modest target, chasing it down in just 10.1 overs. Sunil Narine smashed a blistering 44 off 18 balls, setting the tone with his fearless hitting. Quinton de Kock (23) and Ajinkya Rahane (20*) provided support, while Rinku Singh (15* off 12) finished it off in style.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/205aea18-0a96-45f6-bd61-c116ba46a8e9_1744391510.png\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>MS Dhoni (Chennai Super Kings Captain):<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>&quot;Some nights just don&rsquo;t roll in your favour, and this was another one of those. We&rsquo;ve got to return to the basics, reassess where we&rsquo;re faltering, and accept the challenge head-on. The truth is&mdash;we just didn&rsquo;t have enough on the board today.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>The ball was holding up again, like it has in a few games where we bowled first. But if you keep losing wickets in clusters, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what the pitch is doing&mdash;it becomes a tough game. We never really stitched together a partnership and that put a lot of pressure on the incoming batters.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>That said, it&rsquo;s not all doom and gloom. We&rsquo;ve played some solid cricket earlier this season. What&rsquo;s crucial is that we stay true to our strengths. Our openers are quality players&mdash;they don&rsquo;t need to slog, they need support and time to build. We can&rsquo;t afford to be chasing the scoreboard too early. If we&rsquo;re losing three or four in the powerplay, we&rsquo;re only making it harder for the middle order. It&rsquo;s about being smart, trusting the process, and building partnerships that win you games.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Ajinkya Rahane (Kolkata Knight Riders Captain):<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>&quot;We came in with a clear mindset, a lot of thought went into our plans. Having spent a couple of years here in Chennai, both Moeen and Bravo had their say as well. We expected the surface to play a touch better, but it turned out a bit more sluggish than anticipated. That said, our plans came through beautifully tonight.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>When it comes to what we had in store for CSK, I&rsquo;ll keep that under wraps&mdash;still a long road in the tournament, and cards need to be kept close to the chest.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Swapping Johnson for Moeen? On a night like this, it felt like the right move. Moeen showed great maturity, especially considering he&#39;s been in and out of the XI. He stuck to his strengths and delivered under pressure. Varun and Sunny were outstanding&mdash;they completely owned the middle overs. Vaibhav and Harshit at the top were clinical. It was a total team effort.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>On a personal note, I&rsquo;ve been keeping things simple. Been grinding hard over the last two years, especially in this format, and now it&rsquo;s all coming together.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>We didn&rsquo;t talk about net run rate at the start, but once we got a foothold in the game, we saw the opportunity. We pushed for a quick finish to give that NRR a healthy bump. It&rsquo;s all about momentum from here&mdash;no more alternate wins, we want to string them together.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Sunil Narine (Player of the Match):<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>&quot;That felt close to a complete performance. Just a small regret&mdash;I should&rsquo;ve held on to that catch, Harshit was in for something special there.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>For me, it&rsquo;s always about sticking to my strengths. The moment you start reacting too much to what the batter is doing, you lose your edge. I keep things simple and back what I do best.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Conditions are part of the puzzle. You get used to how things behave with time&mdash;feel out the pitch early, assess the powerplay, and then go about executing the plans accordingly.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>With the bat, my job is straightforward&mdash;give the team a flying start. It won&rsquo;t come off every time, but the intent is always there. I&rsquo;ll look to bring the same approach into the next game and keep contributing where I can.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n",

Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru as the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) host the Delhi Capitals (DC) in match number 24 of the TATA IPL 2025! The stakes are high, and the excitement is palpable as these two top teams clash in a battle for supremacy.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>RCB have been on a tear, with impressive victories against top-notch opponents in Chennai, Mumbai, and Kolkata. Their only loss in the tournament came against the table-toppers Gujarat Titans. The batting unit has been led by the consistent Kohli, Patidar, and Salt, while the bowling department has shown promise with the trio of Hazlewood, Bhuvi, and Dayal.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Meanwhile, DC are riding high as the only unbeaten team in the tournament. They&#39;re looking to continue their momentum, and their journey has been marked by signs of brilliance from every individual. Ashutosh Sharma&#39;s match-winning performance in the first game, followed by Mitchell Starc&#39;s brilliant bowling display against SRH, and a thrilling win against CSK at the MA Chidambaram Stadium after 15 long years, have all contributed to their impressive start.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>This high-octane encounter promises to be an electrifying one! Will DC continue their dominance and remain unbeaten, or will RCB halt their streak and claim their first home win of the season? The M.

He&rsquo;s been in red-hot form since the Champions Trophy.&quot;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\n<strong>KL Rahul | Player of the Match:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;Being behind the stumps for 20 overs gave me real insight into the surface. It wasn&rsquo;t dual-paced, but the ball was sticking. I just wanted to get off to a good start and then build from there.As a keeper, you observe what works and where to hit, and I used that to my advantage.<br \/>\nThis is my home ground &mdash; I&rsquo;ve played here a lot and always love coming back. I experiment in the nets, train to adapt to different wickets. That way it becomes second nature to adjust. You have to read the conditions, identify your scoring pockets, and stay sharp. That&rsquo;s what worked today.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n",

      "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the grand theatre of cricket &ndash; the Narendra Modi Stadium &ndash; where strategy meets spectacle, and pressure turns coal into diamonds! We&rsquo;ve got the Gujarat Titans locking horns with the Rajasthan Royals in what promises to be a cricketing epic!This venue isn&rsquo;t just turf and stands &ndash; it&rsquo;s alive!The pitch can flatter the pacers early, grip for the spinners in the middle, and then turn into a slippery slope with the dew late in the evening. It&rsquo;s a surface that tests not just skill, but smarts!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Gujarat Titans have roared into second place riding on the power trio &ndash; Shubman Gill, Sai Sudharsan, and Jos Buttler &ndash; who&rsquo;ve scored the majority of the team&rsquo;s runs. But here&#39;s the catch &ndash; that middle order hasn&rsquo;t been under the pump yet. If Rajasthan can crack that top three early, we&rsquo;ll find out what the Titans are really made of!The Royals, meanwhile, are peaking at the right time! Jofra Archer is bowling thunderbolts again, and the spin duo of Hasaranga and Theekshana are weaving webs. And don&rsquo;t sleep on the youngsters &ndash; Dhruv Jurel and Nitish Rana have been clutch in the middle. Yashasvi Jaiswal&rsquo;s form is ticking upward too. Ooh, it&rsquo;s simmering! With Mohammed Siraj firing on all cylinders and Rashid Khan bowling with venom, Gujarat has the tools. But this one&rsquo;s going to be a chess match at 150 kmph. The team that reads the pitch quicker, holds their nerve longer, and finishes stronger &ndash; they&rsquo;ll walk away with the points.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Get ready, folks. This isn&rsquo;t just a match &ndash; it&rsquo;s mayhem in the making!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (18)_1744204890.gif\" \/>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<strong>IPL Stats at Narendra Modi Stadium Since 2024:<\/strong><br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 - 2025-04-09T182904_1744206782.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report | Pommie Mbangwa &amp; Simon Katich<\/strong><br \/>\n&ldquo;Welcome, folks &mdash; time to assess the conditions here at the Narendra Modi Stadium, and let me tell you, the outfield is an absolute dream. Smooth as silk, quick as a flash &mdash; it&#39;s like a billiards table out there. The square boundaries? One side&rsquo;s 60 meters, the other 71. Straight down the ground? 73 meters. As a bowler, you&rsquo;ve got to be very smart with your angles tonight.We&rsquo;re on pitch seven &mdash; red soil base with a noticeable green tinge on top. But make no mistake, this is a belter! The surface has hosted four games across the last two seasons, and we&rsquo;ve seen totals north of 220, even 230. That bounce and pace off the red soil make it a batter&rsquo;s paradise. If you bat first, you&#39;ve got to post a big score &mdash; because once the ball starts flying, there&#39;s no holding it back!Put runs on the board, apply scoreboard pressure. Just like we saw last night with Punjab Kings. The ball skids beautifully under lights, so defending becomes a bit easier once you&#39;ve got 200-plus on the board.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (15)_1744207004.gif\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE: <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#ff0066\">Won the Toss and Elected to Field&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

He was well supported by Shahrukh Khan (36 off 20) and a fiery late cameo from *<em>Rahul Tewatia (24<\/em> off 12)**. Titans posted a commanding 217\/6, capitalizing on some indisciplined bowling by RR, with Tushar Deshpande (2\/53) and Theekshana (2\/54) taking the brunt of the damage.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>In reply, RR faltered early &mdash; losing two wickets inside three overs. Despite a fighting 41 from skipper Sanju Samson and a crisp 52 from Hetmyer, the rest of the batting crumbled under scoreboard pressure.

That extra cushion really hurt us later.With Hetmyer at the crease, the boundaries were flowing &mdash; fours, sixes, everything &mdash; but losing my wicket at that stage really tilted the game. That&rsquo;s where we lost the grip.Jofra gave us a great start, getting Shubman early, but then we drifted off-plan. We&rsquo;ll have to sit down and reassess that tomorrow. Yes, after a loss, questions come up &mdash; should we have chased, should we have done something different? But as a team, we want to back ourselves to win games while chasing, not just when we bat first.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Shubman Gill | GT Captain<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;We put up a very good total. It wasn&#39;t easy early on &mdash; the ball was nipping around in the first 3&ndash;4 overs. Full credit to Sai and Jos, they batted tremendously to get us to that score. Honestly, we&rsquo;d take 220 on this surface any day.Our fast bowlers are doing a tremendous job &mdash; everyone&rsquo;s stepping up. When you can&rsquo;t easily pick a Player of the Match, that&rsquo;s the hallmark of a complete team effort.Captaincy becomes easy when you have this kind of bowling unit. Whoever I throw the ball to, they&rsquo;re ready and hungry to deliver. And of course, having Ishi bhai (Ishant Sharma) around &mdash; someone who&rsquo;s played 100 Tests &mdash; makes a big difference to the group.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Sai Sudharsan | Player of the Match:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;In the IPL, momentum at the start of the tournament is really important. So it&#39;s a joy to contribute and help the team get the win tonight.The pitch was seaming early on, so we had to assess quickly. You can&rsquo;t take too much time in T20s, so we made the most of the second half of the powerplay. The plan was simple &mdash; keep wickets in hand, and it worked beautifully.There&rsquo;s a clear understanding within the group. If we lose early wickets, the set batter takes responsibility. If not, we make sure to give the hitters a solid platform so they can explode in the final 5&ndash;7 overs.Personally, I always focus on what I can improve. I&#39;m working on my game awareness and refining my skills. Honestly, I just try to keep my basics strong &mdash; and that&rsquo;s helping me evolve into a more versatile batter.&rdquo;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n",

      "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>Fasten your seatbelts, folks! We&rsquo;ve got a mouthwatering contest on our hands as Punjab Kings take on Chennai Super Kings at the brand-new Mullanpur cauldron! Two heavyweight franchises, both under pressure, both hungry for a turnaround&mdash;and make no mistake, this one&rsquo;s going to be a firecracker!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Punjab Kings have blown hot and cold so far. Their campaign took a hit with a hefty loss against Rajasthan, but with Shreyas Iyer at the helm and young guns like Nehal Wadhera firing, they&rsquo;ve got the firepower. Ricky Ponting will be urging his boys to bring the heat&mdash;especially with spin being their Achilles heel last time out.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>On the other side, the mighty Chennai Super Kings are looking for answers. Three losses on the bounce, and questions being asked of the top order. MS Dhoni&rsquo;s doing the job with the bat lower down, but CSK need their engine room to start firing. Ruturaj and the boys will know: you don&rsquo;t win titles in April, but you sure can lose momentum.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Expect spin to play a big part, toss to be crucial, and pressure to be sky-high. Strap in. This isn&#39;t just a game&mdash;this is IPL theatre at its very best!&nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (17)_1744119154.gif\" \/>&nbsp;<\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report | Daren Ganga and Michael Clarke:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&quot;We&#39;re in Chandigarh for Punjab Kings&#39; second home game, where they&#39;ll be facing off against Chennai Super Kings. Both teams come into this match off losses. Notably, we&rsquo;ve switched pitches. The boundaries are different now, with the square boundaries at 7m and the straight boundary stretching to 74m. Batters, especially right-handers, will likely target the leg side. Michael Clarke is with me. Looking at the pitch, it resembles the one used in Punjab Kings&#39; match against the Royals. Dew doesn&#39;t seem like a factor tonight.Both wickets look similar, and though you can spot a few dry patches, the surface remained pretty steady on Saturday. I don&rsquo;t think the toss will have a huge impact. The key here is the length of your deliveries. Overpitching is beneficial for the batters as the ball comes onto the bat nicely, allowing them to hit through the line. But if you bowl too short, especially with slower pace, it&rsquo;ll play into the batters&rsquo; hands. Hitting the top of the stumps length is the sweet spot here. That&rsquo;s the key in both the powerplay and at the death.&quot;&nbsp;<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (14)_1744120876.gif\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE : <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/PK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:54px\" title=\"\" \/><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">&nbsp;Won the Toss and Elected to Bat&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

Despite a middle-order wobble, Shashank Singh (52 off 36)* and Marco Jansen (34 off 19)* added late firepower, pushing PBKS to a daunting 219\/6. Arya&rsquo;s strokeplay was ruthless &mdash; 9 sixes and 7 boundaries in a fearless inning that laid the foundation.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>CSK&rsquo;s chase began briskly with Rachin Ravindra (36) and Devon Conway (69 retired out) building a solid platform. But a mid-innings squeeze and regular wickets &mdash; including Dube (42) and Dhoni (27 off 12) &mdash; slowed their momentum. A tactical retire-out of Conway raised eyebrows, but even late fireworks from Dhoni and Jadeja couldn&#39;t bridge the gap as CSK finished at 201\/5.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lockie Ferguson (2\/40) and Maxwell (1\/11) delivered crucial breakthroughs, while Yash Thakur held his nerve at the death. With this win, PBKS not only get off the mark at home but also hand CSK a reality check in the race to the playoffs.&nbsp;<\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Ruturaj Gaikwad | Chennai Super Kings Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>&ldquo;In the last four games, dropped catches have been the real difference. Every time we miss one, the same batter adds 20&ndash;30 extra runs &mdash; that&rsquo;s costly. If you take out the RCB game, our last three losses have come down to just two or three big hits.Credit to Priyansh &mdash; he played fearless cricket, took risks, and they paid off. Even though we kept picking wickets, they maintained the pressure and momentum. Maybe 10&ndash;15 runs fewer, with better execution and catching, and it could&rsquo;ve been a different story.From a batting point of view, today was spot-on. Our best players against pace were up the order and made full use of the powerplay. Conway timed the ball well early on, but once we saw him slowing down, we made the call to bring in Jaddu for the finishing role.We&rsquo;re emphasizing fielding &mdash; told the team to enjoy it, not feel nervous. One good catch or boundary save can lift the entire group. While you can have off days with bat or ball, fielding is all about mindset &mdash; and it&rsquo;s something we must improve going forward.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Shreyas Iyer | Punjab Kings Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&ldquo;This is the template we&rsquo;re looking to build &mdash; no matter the ground. We have variety, power, and great timing throughout our batting unit.Priyansh was simply outstanding today. I had a chat with him last match when he looked a bit unsure against Jofra. But today, he went out with total clarity. Backed his instincts, went after the ball when it was there, and played one of the best knocks I&rsquo;ve seen in the IPL so far.&nbsp;That was a tactical call. Dube was set, Conway was still at the crease. We felt pace-off deliveries into the pitch would be more effective at that stage. Yuzi is a class bowler, no doubt, but sometimes you have to trust your gut in crunch moments &mdash; and it worked out today.We&rsquo;re yet to put together a perfect game. Fielding is a mindset &mdash; once the boys start attacking the ball fearlessly, we&rsquo;ll get there. We&rsquo;ll regroup, train harder, and work on turning those half-chances into moments that win us matches.&rdquo;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Priyansh Arya | Player of the Match:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>&ldquo;Sir, it feels out of this world. I&rsquo;m really happy with my performance, but I&rsquo;m even more focused on contributing more for the team going forward<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>The intent was always to stay positive. I had a chat with Shreyas bhaiya before the game, and he told me &mdash; if it&rsquo;s in your zone, go for it from ball one. That gave me the confidence to back my instincts.<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>When Nehal came in, I asked if I should slow down, but he encouraged me to stick to my natural game &mdash; and that helped me stay in rhythm. CSK&rsquo;s bowlers are top quality, any of them can challenge you, but I just wanted to trust my game and keep attacking.&rdquo;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n",

With a surface expected to aid turn, the trio of Varun Chakaravarthy, Sunil Narine, and Moeen Ali could prove decisive.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>LSG, meanwhile, are riding on individual brilliance.

Interestingly, chasing sides have won more often here, adding intrigue to the toss.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>KKR&rsquo;s home advantage, bolstered by a strong bowling core, sets the tone.

We&rsquo;ve got a fresh pitch today, and it&rsquo;s an intriguing one. The square is skewed &mdash; to my right, the boundary is just 57 meters, while to my left it stretches out to 70 meters. Straight down the ground, it&rsquo;s 69 meters.&nbsp;Day games can be unpredictable when it comes to run-scoring. Now, there is grass on this pitch, but what&rsquo;s interesting is how hard and rigid it feels to the touch. That tells me it might grip and hold a bit as the day wears on &mdash; which means batting could get tougher.&nbsp;Do you bat first or back your side to chase?&quot;Well, most captains these days love to chase and will say they&rsquo;ll assess the conditions. But personally, I&rsquo;d like to bat first here. I don&rsquo;t think this surface is going to change too much. And with those short boundaries, you&rsquo;ve got to be tactical and aware from ball one.&quot;&nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (13)_1744104995.gif\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE: <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/KKR-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#8e44ad\">Won the Toss and Elected to Field&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

Batting first, LSG posted a mammoth 238\/3, riding on a blistering unbeaten 87 off 36 balls from Nicholas Pooran and a classy 81 from Mitchell Marsh. The duo combined with Aiden Markram (47) to unleash carnage on KKR&rsquo;s bowling unit, particularly punishing Spencer Johnson and Andre Russell who leaked 78 runs in 5 overs combined.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Chasing 239, KKR showed tremendous fight with Ajinkya Rahane (61) and Venkatesh Iyer (45) laying the platform after quickfire cameos from Narine (30) and de Kock (15). Rinku Singh threatened to steal the game yet again with a breathtaking 38 off 15*, but the target proved just out of reach as KKR finished on 234\/7.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Despite leaking runs, LSG bowlers picked timely wickets &mdash; Akash Deep and Thakur claiming two apiece &mdash; while Digvesh Rathi&#39;s economical spell proved vital.

I mentioned at the toss &mdash; this pitch stays true throughout, so no complaints there. We gave it everything, just fell short by four runs in the end.Chasing 230-plus, you&#39;re going to lose a few wickets along the way. We were prepared for that. I think the surface was excellent &mdash; maybe our batters could&rsquo;ve taken a little more time early on.Our bowling attack usually controls the middle overs well, especially with Sunil and Varun. But tonight, it was tough &mdash; Sunil was struggling a bit and conditions didn&rsquo;t help the spinners much. Still, credit to the team for the fight we showed.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Rishabh Pant | LSG Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&ldquo;When we were batting, we didn&rsquo;t quite realise how tight it would get. But after the powerplay, we knew it could go down to the wire.At the first timeout, we kept things simple &mdash; told the bowlers to stick to their plans and not overthink. It&#39;s easy to try too many things when you&#39;re being hit around, but discipline wins games.We also tried to slow things down when the game was moving fast. Sometimes that helps shift momentum &mdash; thankfully, it worked in our favour today.Keeping the left-right combo in the middle was a tactical call. Given their spin attack, it gave us the best chance to keep the scoring going and disrupt their rhythm &mdash; and it paid off.&rdquo;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Nicholas Pooran | Player of the Match:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&ldquo;I get asked this a lot &mdash; but honestly, it all comes down to practice. What you see out there is the result of hours of hard work. Right now, everything&rsquo;s flowing nicely, and I&rsquo;m just trusting the process.It&rsquo;s important to read the game &mdash; bowlers are mixing it up with full, wide, straight, short, slower deliveries. Once you understand that, you prepare accordingly. I&rsquo;ve been working on those areas, and thankfully, it&#39;s helping the team.Full credit to Aiden and Mitch &mdash; they&rsquo;ve been outstanding. They&rsquo;re batting with intent, building partnerships, and most importantly, playing for the team. No egos, just smart cricket. That&rsquo;s been key for us as a batting group.As for my role at No. 3, it&rsquo;s simple: get in, assess, and attack the right match-ups. I&rsquo;ve been given that responsibility this season, and I&rsquo;m enjoying it. The opportunity is there, and I just want to keep making the most of it.&rdquo;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n",

      "PreMatchCommentary": "<p style=\"margin-left:0; margin-right:0\"><strong>Welcome to the Wankhede Stadium, where the temperature and stakes are rising! It&#39;s Mumbai Indians versus Royal Challengers Bengaluru&mdash;a matchup that is never short on drama. Tonight, it comes with added layers of redemption and reputations on the line.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0; margin-right:0\">&nbsp;<strong>The Mumbai Indians are currently struggling, facing three losses in four matches. They have had a rough time during the PowerPlay and are still searching for a rhythm. However, Jasprit Bumrah is back&mdash;the X-factor, the enforcer, the player who can change the game with a single spell. With the ball likely to swing early in the humid Mumbai conditions, Bumrah could set the tone for his team.<\/strong>&nbsp;<strong>Rohit Sharma has also returned after recovering from a knee injury. His performance at the top of the order will be crucial in lifting the spirits of an MI camp that has looked uncharacteristically shaky.<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0; margin-right:0\"><strong>On the other hand, Royal Challengers Bengaluru are still trying to establish their identity this season&mdash;sometimes electric, other times exposed. After being humbled by the Gujarat Titans, they will be eager to move on quickly. Adding to the intrigue are three former MI players&mdash;Tim David, Romario Shepherd, and Nuwan Thushara&mdash;who now wear the RCB red. You can bet they will be highly motivated for this clash.<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0; margin-right:0\"><strong>As for the weather, expect muggy and heavy air&mdash;think sweat, swing, and skiddy seam movement. This match isn&rsquo;t just about competing; it&rsquo;s about breaking patterns. The Mumbai Indians need to shake off their early-season slumber, while the Royal Challengers Bengaluru have yet to record a win at Wankhede against MI in the last five years.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (15)_1744031285.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\nIPL Stats At Wankhede Stadium Since 2024:<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 - 2025-04-07T185102_1744032170.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/>&nbsp;<\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report | Natalie Germanos &amp; Simon Katich:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&quot;We&rsquo;re back at the iconic Wankhede, but not on the same track we saw earlier this season. That game was on pitch number six &ndash; today, it&rsquo;s pitch number eight. While we&rsquo;re still dealing with asymmetrical dimensions &ndash; it&rsquo;s 66 metres to the off-side, 61 to the leg-side, and a pretty long straight boundary at 74 &ndash; what&rsquo;s changed is the breeze. It&#39;s gusty here tonight in Mumbait.The wind is definitely a factor today, and you wonder if it might have an impact on the dew. If dew does come in, especially with this breeze, we know the ball skids on and becomes a nightmare for bowlers &ndash; particularly under lights. That&rsquo;s why teams prefer chasing here.Now looking at the surface &ndash; it&rsquo;s rock hard, typical Wankhede. There&rsquo;s a healthy grass cover but a few patches look barer on one end, which could bring in a little variable bounce. Not expecting much turn, to be honest &ndash; this is going to be a batter&rsquo;s paradise.One key stat &ndash; Mumbai have been poor in the powerplay this season, while RCB&rsquo;s economy rate with the new ball has been the best in the league. So it&rsquo;s going to be all about who wins that early battle &ndash; because with this outfield and these dimensions, if you don&rsquo;t get your lengths right, you&rsquo;ll be fishing the ball out of the stands. With wind in play and a pitch begging to be hit, this has all the ingredients for another Wankhede run-feast!&quot;<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (12)_1744034220.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0; margin-right:0\"><strong>TOSS UPDATE: <span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/MI-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:29px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp;Won the Toss and Elected to Field&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

Not much else to say.It was a flat wicket, tough for bowlers. You can&#39;t fault them too much&mdash;if batters connect, there&#39;s no stopping them. Maybe we fell short by 10-12 runs.Naman was always meant to bat lower down. With Rohit unavailable last game, we had to reshuffle. He&rsquo;s versatile, and with Ro back, Naman returned to his original role.He was brilliant today. People didn&rsquo;t know, but he took a hard hit before the last match. It was a tactical decision then, but today he showed real class.Powerplay is key in a chase like this. We couldn&rsquo;t capitalize in those crucial overs and fell behind. RCB executed well at the death.Having him back is massive. He did his job like always, and it&rsquo;s just great to have him in the squad.You never back down. We keep looking at the positives, keep fighting, and the results will follow. We believe in our group.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Rajat Patidar | RCB Captain &amp; Player of the Match:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&ldquo;It was an incredible game. Very tough, but I&rsquo;m proud of how the bowlers held their nerve. This award truly belongs to the bowling unit. Defending a total at Wankhede isn&rsquo;t easy, but the way they executed their plans&mdash;especially in the death&mdash;was outstanding. Special mention to Krunal Pandya, bowling the last over under that kind of pressure and nailing it, just shows the courage in this team. Our strategy during the time-out was clear&mdash;take the game deep and save KP&rsquo;s over for the end. It worked perfectly.The pitch was a typical Mumbai deck&mdash;true bounce and great for batting. After Hardik&rsquo;s over, I felt it was time to shift gears and take the attack to them.&nbsp;In this format, wrist-spinners are key. Suyash bowled brilliantly, especially from the shorter end&mdash;he&rsquo;s a wicket-taker and showed great control.Personally, I just wanted to make an impact&mdash;put pressure on the bowlers and push the scoring rate. Glad it came off today.&rdquo;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n",

With both sides at contrasting ends of form and confidence, this encounter promises to be a crucial juncture in their respective campaigns.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Sunrisers Hyderabad began their season with a dominant 44-run win over Rajasthan Royals, putting up a mammoth 286 on the board. However, their form has dipped since, suffering three straight defeats. Their most recent loss came against Kolkata Knight Riders, where they were bundled out for just 120. The opening pair of Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head, who showed promise earlier, haven&rsquo;t quite found their rhythm, which has contributed to their batting woes. On the brighter side, young Aniket Verma has emerged as a dependable batter amidst the inconsistency. The bowling department, though, continues to search for breakthroughs and balance.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Gujarat Titans have shown strong signs of stability under Shubman Gill&rsquo;s leadership. After narrowly losing their opener, they bounced back with two impressive wins. Jos Buttler has been in explosive form at the top, while Sai Sudharsan has provided solidity through the middle. Left-arm spinner Sai Kishore has also delivered key spells, strengthening their bowling unit. Their recent victory over Bengaluru was a complete performance, led by Siraj&rsquo;s three-wicket haul and Buttler&rsquo;s unbeaten 73.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>With Hyderabad desperate to get back to winning ways and Gujarat aiming to continue their momentum, this contest carries significant weight. Will SRH rediscover their spark at home, or will GT&rsquo;s all-round form prevail once again? Expect a high-octane evening of T20 action in Hyderabad.&nbsp;<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (13)_1743945048.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\nStats at Hyderabad Since IPL 2024:<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 - 2025-04-06T185935_1743947572.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\nPitch Report | Danny Morrison &amp; Varun Aaron:<\/strong><br \/>\n&quot;The conditions are absolutely superb tonight. As for the dimensions&mdash;it&#39;s 70 meters to my right, 63 to the left, and if you&#39;re aiming downtown, it&#39;s 76 meters. Let&#39;s bring in our pitch expert for this match, &nbsp;This is one of those venues where it&rsquo;s a lot more comfortable doing a pitch report than actually bowling on it! That said, Pitch 4 is slightly on the slower side. Over the past three years, the highest score recorded here has been just 165, which tells you a bit about the nature of this surface. It does appear a bit dry. I spoke to the curator earlier and he mentioned the surface is expected to stay compact through the game. That means slower deliveries and off-cutters could be particularly useful&mdash;perhaps an opportunity for someone like Jaydev Unadkat to come into play today.&quot;&nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (11)_1743946374.gif\" \/>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>&nbsp;TOSS UPDATE:<\/strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/GT-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:32px\" title=\"\" \/>Won the Toss and Elected to Field&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

Mohammed Siraj was unplayable with the new ball. He struck twice in the powerplay, removing Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma in quick succession. Siraj finished with sensational figures of 4 for 17, including a peach to bowl Simarjeet Singh and a milestone 100th IPL wicket.Despite a few starts from Ishan Kishan (17), Nitish Kumar Reddy (31), and Heinrich Klaasen (27), SRH never built the momentum they needed. Pat Cummins&rsquo; late cameo (22* off 9) and a couple of handy blows from Shami (6* off 2) pushed the score to 152\/8&mdash;well below par on this surface.In reply, Gujarat Titans had an early wobble, losing Sai Sudharsan and Jos Buttler inside four overs. But Washington Sundar walked out at No. 4 and turned the tide. The southpaw counter-attacked with flair, hammering 49 off just 29 balls, including five boundaries and two sixes.Shubman Gill anchored the chase beautifully, timing the ball to perfection and finding gaps with surgical precision. His unbeaten 61 off 43 ensured there were no further hiccups. Sherfane Rutherford added the finishing touches with a blazing 35* off 16, carting six boundaries and a maximum to seal the chase in just 16.4 overs.The Titans&#39; clinical display with bat and ball was a statement performance. Siraj&rsquo;s new-ball burst, Gill&rsquo;s class, and Sundar&rsquo;s counter-punch proved too good for a Sunrisers&nbsp;<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/Postmatchnew_1743961538.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pat Cummins | Sunrisers Hyderabad Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>&quot;Yeah, it wasn&rsquo;t your typical Hyderabad surface tonight. The pitch made it tough to find rhythm or fluency with the bat. We were hoping to grab a few early wickets during the powerplay to keep ourselves in the contest.It didn&rsquo;t quite turn as much as we expected either, and the bit of dew in the second innings certainly didn&rsquo;t work in our favour.We were actually torn between Chahar and Simarjeet. After watching how the surface behaved early on, we felt the pacers were getting a bit more out of it, so we backed Simarjeet to come in.&quot;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Shubman Gill | Gujarat Titans Captain:<br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;Bowlers are true game-changers in this format. While T20 is often about power-hitting and big scores, I genuinely believe matches are won by bowlers.It was about playing proper cricketing shots, keeping it simple. Washi and I spoke about building a solid partnership &mdash; staying calm and then accelerating when needed.He was actually very close to playing against Mumbai as well. He was padded up, ready to go in. The impact player rule allowed us to balance things out with an extra bowler, but today, Washi showed his class. That knock was outstanding.The energy he brings with the ball and in the field is just contagious. When you play against him, you know he&rsquo;s a threat. When he&rsquo;s in your team, he lifts everyone &mdash; it&rsquo;s a different vibe altogether.&quot;&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Mohammed Siraj | Player of the Match:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;It&rsquo;s a special feeling to perform at my home ground, especially with my family in the stands &mdash; that energy gives you a different kind of belief.I spent seven incredible years at RCB &mdash; that place shaped me. Had my share of highs and lows there. I&#39;ve worked a lot on my bowling, my fitness, and most importantly, my mental strength. Staying in the present is something I&rsquo;ve focused on &mdash; and it&rsquo;s made a big difference.It was tough to accept &mdash; honestly, it took time to digest. But I told myself, this isn&rsquo;t the end. I focused on what I could control: mindset, preparation, and fitness. I was playing consistently, so it wasn&rsquo;t easy to understand what went wrong, but now I&rsquo;m just enjoying my bowling again.As a professional, when you&rsquo;ve been part of the Indian team for a while and then get dropped, self-doubt creeps in. But I shifted my focus to the IPL and stayed positive.When you&rsquo;re executing your plans and the ball&rsquo;s wobbling like that &mdash; it doesn&rsquo;t matter who&rsquo;s batting. You feel on top of the world.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n",

      "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>The IPL 2025 caravan rolls into Mullanpur as Punjab Kings take on Rajasthan Royals in what promises to be a high-voltage contest in Match 18 of the tournament. Both teams arrive with contrasting trajectories &mdash; Punjab have looked dominant at home with back-to-back wins, while Rajasthan are seeking consistency after a mixed start.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Punjab Kings have emerged as one of the early frontrunners this season. Their success has been built on solid top-order performances, with skipper Shreyas Iyer in sublime touch. His unbeaten 97 in the opening match, followed by a steady half-century in the next, has given PBKS much-needed stability. With the ball, Arshdeep Singh has led the pace attack confidently, ably supported by a trio of multi-skilled all-rounders in Glenn Maxwell, Marco Jansen, and Marcus Stoinis. Their bowling group has looked balanced, capable of striking early and containing runs in the middle overs.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Rajasthan Royals, meanwhile, will look to build on the momentum gained from their recent victory against Chennai. Nitish Rana&rsquo;s explosive knock breathed new life into their batting, while Wanindu Hasaranga&rsquo;s four-wicket haul signalled a return to form for the spin attack. The trio of Hasaranga, Theekshana, and Archer have shown encouraging signs of rhythm, and with Sandeep Sharma&rsquo;s control at the death, RR&rsquo;s bowling unit seems to be settling in well. The return of Sanju Samson as captain adds clarity to leadership, though concerns remain around Yashasvi Jaiswal&rsquo;s form at the top, with the team hopeful of a turnaround from the young opener.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>As two well-matched sides prepare to face off, this game holds the potential to shift early-season momentum. With form, match-ups, and home advantage in play, expect an intense battle when Punjab and Rajasthan take the field.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (11)_1743859459.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\nToss Update: <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">PBKS bowl first after winning the toss!<\/span>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

Batting first, RR piled on an imposing 205\/4, powered by Yashasvi Jaiswal&rsquo;s fluent 67 and Riyan Parag&rsquo;s explosive unbeaten 43 off 25 balls. Sanju Samson and Nitish Rana chipped in with brisk cameos, while Punjab&rsquo;s bowlers struggled to contain the flow of runs, especially in the latter stages.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>In reply, Punjab Kings suffered early setbacks, losing three wickets inside the first four overs. Jofra Archer&rsquo;s fiery new-ball spell put the Royals firmly in control. However, Nehal Wadhera stood out with a spirited 62 off just 41 deliveries, keeping PBKS in the hunt during the middle phase. His stroke play was confident and well-timed, briefly giving Punjab a glimmer of hope.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Despite his efforts, wickets fell regularly at the other end. Glenn Maxwell added a quick 30, but Rajasthan&rsquo;s bowling attack &mdash; led by Archer (3\/25), Theekshana, and Sandeep Sharma &mdash; was disciplined and efficient. Hasaranga and Kartikeya kept things tight through the middle overs, not allowing Punjab to build momentum.<\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/image (39)_1743877022.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Shreyas Iyer (PBKS Captain):<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;Honestly, we were targeting somewhere between 180 to 185. That felt like a good score to chase here. Unfortunately, we couldn&rsquo;t quite execute our plans the way we intended. That said, I&rsquo;m actually glad this kind of game happened early in the tournament&mdash;it gives us a chance to reset.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>It was a decent pitch, slightly on the slower side with the ball holding up a bit. We weren&rsquo;t offering much pace, but I think we could&rsquo;ve paced our innings better&mdash;maybe slowed it down, focused on building partnerships. We lost wickets in quick succession, which made it tough for new batters to settle in.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>We had anticipated some dew, but it didn&rsquo;t show up tonight. So we&#39;ll go back, review the footage, and look at the moments where we slipped, both with bat and ball. These are crucial learnings.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>One big positive was Nehal&mdash;he was outstanding under pressure. Took his time, assessed the conditions, and then took the game to the bowlers. Performances like that are what we want to see.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Sometimes, an early hiccup is just what you need to realign and sharpen your focus. I&rsquo;m confident we&rsquo;ll bounce back stronger.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Sanju Samson (Rajasthan Royals Captain):<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#ff00ff\"><strong>&quot;Thank you so much. I think the way we started in the powerplay with the bat was solid, though we did end up a few runs short of where we wanted to be. But the way everyone showed their intent and batsmanship was brilliant. I had a feeling it wouldn&rsquo;t be easy for them to chase in the second innings&mdash;205 was a very good total on this surface.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff00ff\"><strong>As I&rsquo;ve said before, we have a deep batting line-up. A lot of our players might be young, but they carry great potential and international experience. That really helps us manage the game better in pressure situations.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff00ff\"><strong>(On Jofra Archer and Sandeep Sharma) &mdash; Absolutely, that&rsquo;s a deadly combo! One&rsquo;s coming in hot at 140, and the other&rsquo;s crafty and clever around 105. We&rsquo;re really happy with how both are going about their business. I&rsquo;ve got a lot of trust in them, especially in high-pressure overs. Jofra doing Jofra things&mdash;we love it when he cranks up the pace. And Sandy, he&rsquo;s easily one of the best death bowlers in India. Just superb.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>Jofra Archer (Player of the Match):<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#ff00ff\"><strong>&quot;At the start of the tournament, games like these are bound to happen. The important thing is I&#39;m happy to be contributing to the team now. When days like this come around, you&rsquo;ve got to make sure you cash in.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff00ff\"><strong>I always say&mdash;enjoy the good days and take the bad ones in your stride. You&rsquo;ve got to understand there&rsquo;ll be times when you get a bit lucky, and other days the batters might. Everyone&rsquo;s putting in the same effort to improve, after all.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff00ff\"><strong>Every day isn&rsquo;t going to be a great one, but when things go your way, you&rsquo;ve got to enjoy it&mdash;because you never know when that tough day is coming.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n",

      "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>The MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai sets the stage for Match 17 of IPL 2025, where Chennai Super Kings (CSK) take on Delhi Capitals (DC) in what promises to be a highly competitive fixture. Both teams have shown their strengths in different ways, and this clash could be a key moment in their early-season journeys.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>CSK come into this contest with one win from three matches. After a strong start against Mumbai Indians, they&rsquo;ve faced two close losses to Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Rajasthan Royals. Captain Ruturaj Gaikwad has been among the positives with the bat, though his participation is under watch due to an elbow concern. In case he is unavailable, MS Dhoni is expected to step in as skipper. The return of Devon Conway could bolster the top order, with Rahul Tripathi possibly moving to a middle-order role. The bowling attack, particularly the spinners, will be central to CSK&rsquo;s strategy on a surface that historically supports turn. Noor Ahmad, who has already picked up nine wickets in the tournament, alongside R Ashwin, will be key assets.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Delhi Capitals have made an impressive start to the season, winning both their games so far. Their campaign began with a remarkable chase against Lucknow, and was followed by a well-rounded performance against Sunrisers Hyderabad. Youngster Ashutosh Sharma played a standout knock in the opening game, while Mitchell Starc led the bowling charge in the second with a five-wicket haul. Faf du Plessis has brought experience and stability at the top, while KL Rahul has offered valuable contributions in the middle order. Their spin duo of Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav will look to make the most of conditions in Chennai.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (10)_1743843248.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\nStats At MA Chidambaram Since IPL 2024:<\/strong><br \/>\nLooking at recent data at Chepauk since IPL 2024, chasing has emerged as a slightly favourable option &mdash; teams batting second have won seven of the last 11 matches. The average first-innings score stands at 171, while teams have been particularly dominant in the Powerplay, scoring an average of 53 runs. Death overs have yielded runs at a brisk 10.3 RPO. Interestingly, pacers have had more of an impact here, claiming 69% of wickets (88 out of 128), while spinners have accounted for the remaining 31% (40 wickets), suggesting that seamers have found ways to succeed despite conditions traditionally aiding spin.<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (5)_1743844258.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report: Matthew Hayden &amp; Eoin Morgan:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Matthew Hayden: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a scorcher today, but there&rsquo;s a gentle breeze that might offer some relief to the players. The side boundaries are on the shorter side&mdash;64 and 70 meters&mdash;while it&rsquo;s a solid 78 meters straight down the ground.&rdquo;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Eoin Morgan: &ldquo;Visually, it&rsquo;s a beautiful surface&mdash;typical Chepauk. There&rsquo;s absolutely no grass, it&rsquo;s been rolled in hard, and underneath, it&rsquo;s pretty firm. But don&rsquo;t be fooled. Batting here requires adjustment. The heat drains you, and the pitch might play a touch two-paced&mdash;especially tricky for new batters trying to get in. For me, the key lies in partnerships. Build them well, rotate the strike, take on the twos in the deep pockets, and that&rsquo;s how you build towards those 180-plus totals.&rdquo;<\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (34)_1743847108.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Toss Update<\/strong>: <span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>DC has won the toss and decided to bat first!&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

Opting to bat first, DC posted a competitive total of 183\/6, thanks to a fluent 77 from KL Rahul and a late flourish from Tristan Stubbs, who remained unbeaten on 24 off 12 balls. Abishek Porel and Axar Patel chipped in with handy cameos, while CSK&rsquo;s spinners Ravindra Jadeja and Noor Ahmad kept things tight in the middle overs.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>In response, CSK had a sluggish start, losing three wickets inside the Powerplay. Skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad stood tall with a gritty 54, and Vijay Shankar (69*) tried to steady the innings, but the chase never really gained momentum.

We&#39;re putting in the effort, trying to improve every day, but things aren&#39;t clicking. Losing too many wickets early has hurt us, and it&rsquo;s been a major concern &mdash; both with the bat and the ball in the powerplay. We&rsquo;re either conceding 15-20 extra runs or collapsing with the bat.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>I feel we&rsquo;re being a bit overcautious in those early overs &mdash; our bowlers are tentative, and batters perhaps a little too mindful of not losing wickets. It&rsquo;s about finding that balance between intent and composure. Right now, it feels like we&#39;re reacting rather than setting the tone.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Since the powerplay, we were always behind the game &mdash; playing catch-up. Once we lost early wickets, we only had one recognized batter left. Credit to DC; they bowled smartly and read the conditions better. Even with Shivam (Dube) at the crease, we were searching for momentum but couldn&rsquo;t quite find it. As a unit, we need to come together, take initiative, and make things happen.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Axar Patel (DC Captain):<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;To be honest, I didn&rsquo;t expect things to look this smooth &mdash; winning three in a row feels great, especially when everyone is contributing and the team looks well-balanced. As a captain, it&rsquo;s satisfying, but I still feel we haven&rsquo;t played that perfect game yet.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>I didn&rsquo;t bowl much today &mdash; part of it was strategic, part of it because of a finger niggle. In every match, we&rsquo;ve seen some brilliant fielding efforts and a few dropped chances too &mdash; that&rsquo;s part of the game.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>The IPL is a long tournament. Momentum can shift at any moment, so it&rsquo;s important to stay grounded and keep doing the right things.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>KL Rahul | Player of the Match:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;I&#39;m quite used to adapting now. Before the IPL began, I was prepping to open the innings, but once I got here, the coach asked me to bat at No. 4 and I was okay with it. It&rsquo;s more of a mental adjustment &mdash; getting into a rhythm and being used to walking in at a particular time.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>When you move up and down the order, it can feel a bit unsettled at first. It takes a few balls to find that comfort, but once you&rsquo;re in, it&#39;s just bat vs ball again. I&#39;ve been working on starting positively from ball one.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Felt good to open today. I began well, got a little scratchy in the middle, but key partnerships &mdash; especially with Porel and Axar &mdash; helped. Porel&rsquo;s quick 20-25 really gave us momentum, that&rsquo;s how T20s go now. Once I got past the halfway mark, I knew I had to accelerate and looked to target specific bowlers and the shorter boundaries.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Towards the end, the heat got to me a bit &mdash; I probably left 15-20 runs out there. Something to learn and manage better next time.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n",

      "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>Match 16 of the IPL 2025 sees Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) take on Mumbai Indians (MI) at the Ekana Stadium in Lucknow. With both teams registering just one win from their first three games, this clash becomes vital in setting the tone for the remainder of their campaigns. MI, thanks to a superior Net Run Rate, sit sixth on the points table, while LSG are just behind in seventh.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\n<strong>Mumbai come into this fixture high on confidence after a comprehensive eight-wicket win over the defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders. That performance helped them shake off a poor start and showcased their potential in all departments. Their PowerPlay bowling came alive with Deepak Chahar and Trent Boult striking early, while debutant Ashwani Kumar stunned everyone with figures of 4\/24 &mdash; the best by an Indian on IPL debut this season. In the chase, Ryan Rickelton anchored the innings with a steady half-century, and Suryakumar Yadav provided the fireworks at the end to seal the win in style.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\n<strong>LSG, however, have had an inconsistent ride. After narrowly losing to Delhi Capitals, they bounced back with a strong win over Sunrisers Hyderabad but were then outplayed by Punjab Kings. Nicholas Pooran has been their standout performer, currently holding the Orange Cap with 189 runs at an impressive average of 63. The rest of the batting unit, especially captain Rishabh Pant, needs to step up. In the bowling department, Shardul Thakur has led the way, but the support cast hasn&#39;t quite clicked yet.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nWith both teams looking to build consistency, this match promises to be an intriguing contest. Can MI continue their comeback, or will LSG hold firm at home?<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (9)_1743771003.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\nIPL Stats At Ekana Stadium:<\/strong><br \/>\nThe surface at the Ekana Stadium continues to be a talking point. Across 14 IPL matches played here, teams batting first and second have split wins equally at 7 apiece, suggesting the toss might not be decisive. The average first-innings score stands at 166, indicating a competitive pitch. Pacers have accounted for 61% of the wickets compared to spinners&rsquo; 39%, showing that seamers tend to have a greater impact. However, the black soil surface can still assist slower bowlers, especially in the middle overs.<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (4)_1743772867.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report &ndash; Daren Ganga:<\/strong><br \/>\n&quot;We&rsquo;re shifting from pitch number 4&mdash;red soil&mdash;to pitch number 6 today, which is black soil. That change in surface brings along a shift in dynamics. First, the dimensions: square boundaries measure 73 and 66 meters, and it&rsquo;s 78 meters straight down the ground.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, let&rsquo;s talk about the deck. It&rsquo;s dark, almost charcoal in tone, and though there&rsquo;s a decent covering of grass, there are plenty of bare patches visible. In the last game here, seam movement was minimal, just 1.4&deg; of spin, and the bounce was true&mdash;ideal for batters to play through the line.<\/p>\n\n<p>But this black soil will play differently. Expect lower bounce and slightly slower pace off the surface. Spinners might enjoy a bit more grip and turn today. Shot-making won&rsquo;t be as free-flowing as the previous game, and timing could be key.<\/p>\n\n<p>The benchmark score batting first here? Around 181. That&rsquo;s the average first innings total, and something teams will keep in mind at the toss.&quot;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (10)_1743774016.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>Toss Update:<\/strong> <span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>MI has won the toss and opted to bowl first!<\/strong><\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

As a unit, we didn&rsquo;t deliver, and I take full responsibility for that.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>As for Tilak&rsquo;s retirement, it was a straightforward call. We needed a few boundaries at that stage, and sometimes in this game, things don&rsquo;t go your way even when you&rsquo;re trying your best.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Looking ahead, it&rsquo;s about simplifying things &mdash; smart bowling, calculated risks with the bat, and sticking to basics with intent. It&rsquo;s a long tournament. A couple of wins, and we&rsquo;ll be back in rhythm.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>Rishabh Pant, LSG Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff\"><strong>&quot;The wicket played really well today. Now it&#39;s about figuring out what&rsquo;s clicking for us and what&rsquo;s not. Earlier, we had a different kind of surface in mind, but then we decided to just back ourselves on whatever pitch we get.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff\"><strong>Getting a good start always puts you ahead in the game. Marsh set the tone beautifully, and that allowed the lower middle order to capitalize later. It was a mentally challenging match &mdash; the opposition didn&rsquo;t lose too many wickets and kept the scoreboard ticking. But we stayed calm under pressure and finished strong.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff\"><strong>[On Shardul Thakur] He&rsquo;s been outstanding for us &mdash; a terrific pick and a proper match-winner. I hope he keeps doing what he&#39;s doing. [On Rathi] He&rsquo;s one of our key bowlers this season. What impresses me most is the way he holds his nerve in crunch moments. That calmness adds real value to the team.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>Digvesh Rathi, Player of the Match:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff\">&quot;I&rsquo;m really enjoying my bowling at the moment. My style is naturally attacking &mdash; I always look to take wickets. Watching Sunil Narine over the years has really inspired me. I admire how he bowls under pressure and delivers for his team. I&rsquo;m trying to develop that same attacking mindset.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff\">[On the Dhir dismissal] In the previous over, I had a chat with Rishabh about our field &ndash; I asked if we should place a midwicket. We decided against it, and I think that played on the batter&rsquo;s mind. He went for that shot and ended up getting bowled. So it was a small call that worked in our favor.&quot;<\/span><\/p>\n",

      "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>The IPL train thunders into Kolkata with a showdown that&rsquo;s got history, heat, and high stakes written all over it. Kolkata Knight Riders&nbsp;vs&nbsp;Sunrisers Hyderabad &mdash; a repeat of last year&rsquo;s grand finale, but this time, both sides are searching for traction in the early turbulence of the tournament.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>For KKR, the wounds from their collapse against Mumbai are still raw. A top-heavy batting order is holding fort, but the middle order &mdash; once their biggest weapon &mdash; has looked short of firepower and execution. Rinku Singh and Andre Russell, known for their back-end brilliance, have misfired at crucial moments, forcing the top to shoulder more than its share of the weight. Yet, there&rsquo;s promise. The veteran touch of Rahane, the flair of de Kock, and the youthful spark of Raghuvanshi hint at a core capable of pulling this team back on track.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The bowling unit, though not short on names, has lacked the killer punch. Too often they&rsquo;ve let games drift away under pressure &mdash; and it&rsquo;s this inconsistency they&rsquo;ll want to shed under the lights in the Eden gardens.On the other side, Sunrisers Hyderabad are no strangers to drama either. They lit up the league early with that statement-making performance, but that momentum seems to have fizzled out. Their explosive brand of batting, once a nightmare for bowlers, has suddenly turned patchy. Head has held the line, but others around him have drifted in and out of form. Amid the fluctuation, the rise of Aniket Verma has added a welcome jolt &mdash; fearless, fluid, and unbothered by the big stage.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>With the ball, SRH are searching for bite. The pace unit, led by Cummins and Shami, has shown flashes of rhythm but hasn&rsquo;t quite hit its stride as a collective force.The emotional undertone makes this contest truly captivating &mdash; a rematch soaked in memories, with SRH desperate to flip the script and KKR looking to reassert supremacy. It&#39;s not just about recovering points &mdash; it&#39;s about rewriting narratives.Kolkata will be buzzing. The past hangs in the balance. Two wounded sides. One shot at revival.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>This is where reputations are challenged and new ones are made. Welcome to Match 15, where IPL turns the volume up once again.<\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (8)_1743686465.gif\" \/>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>Number&#39;s Game at Eden Gardens -&nbsp;<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 - 2025-04-03T185109_1743687302.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>Pitch Report |&nbsp; Pommie Mbangwa &amp; Eoin Morgan<\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;The dimensions tell you a lot about what kind of game we can expect &mdash; it&rsquo;s 75 meters straight, 62 and 64 square on either side, and the boundaries behind the batter are tight, just 57 and 56 meters. If there&rsquo;s pace on offer, expect batters to use those shorter angles &mdash; the ramp, the scoop, everything&#39;s in play.As for the surface itself &mdash; it looks fantastic. Really firm, a great covering of grass across the square, and well-prepared. But right near the crease, there&rsquo;s an interesting patch &mdash; a drier area that could be a factor. If a bowler is bold enough to toss it up and get some revs on it, even with the new ball, there could be some turn early on. Batters lunging forward will need to watch out.That said, don&rsquo;t be fooled &mdash; this is still very much a batter&rsquo;s paradise. We&rsquo;re expecting a high-scoring contest. Early season, a hard deck, and if you&rsquo;re setting a target, you&rsquo;ll want 200 or more on the board. History shows even 176 has been defended, but that&rsquo;s rare.And considering the evening heat and the potential dew later on, the smart move tonight? Win the toss and bowl first. Conditions will only get better under lights, and the ball will skid on beautifully.&nbsp;<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (8)_1743688631.gif\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE: <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/SRH-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" \/><span style=\"color:#d35400\"> Won the Toss and Elected to Field first<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

Skipper Ajinkya Rahane steadied the innings with a composed 38, before the young sensation Angkrish Raghuvanshi and the ever-reliable Venkatesh Iyer stole the show. Raghuvanshi struck a crisp 50 off 32, while Iyer played a thunderous knock of 60 from just 29 balls, taking the attack to SRH&rsquo;s pace battery. Rinku Singh added late fireworks with an unbeaten 32 as KKR posted a commanding 200\/6.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>In reply, SRH&#39;s top order collapsed like a house of cards. Vaibhav Arora struck early blows, dismissing Head and Kishan, while Harshit Rana removed Abhishek Sharma. The middle order offered little resistance, with only Klaasen (33) and Kamindu Mendis (27) showing some fight. Varun Chakaravarthy&rsquo;s clever variations fetched him three wickets, wrapping up the tail alongside Russell&rsquo;s double strike.This was a complete team performance from KKR &mdash; aggressive batting, sharp fielding, and disciplined bowling &mdash; while SRH were left searching for answers after yet another forgettable outing.&nbsp;<\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/7d4fdfdb-17f5-4a62-b7fb-3ab13c61ecaa_1743714771.png\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pat Cummins | Sunrisers Hyderabad Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>&quot;Yeah, not an ideal night for us. At the halfway mark, we felt 200 was a chaseable target on a good batting wicket. But we definitely left a few runs out there in the field, and unfortunately, fell short with the bat as well.We&rsquo;ve got to be realistic. It&#39;s been three games and things haven&rsquo;t quite clicked yet. We always back our batters to play with intent and take aggressive options&mdash;that&rsquo;s their strength. It&#39;s more about how and when we take those options, and maybe we need to explore that a bit more.In the field, we were below par. Gave away 10-15 runs extra through lapses, and KKR batted really well to capitalise.We only bowled three overs of spin, but we felt the cutters were gripping and that was the plan we went with.We&rsquo;ll address the areas that need improvement but won&rsquo;t dwell too long on it. It&rsquo;s a long tournament. Not the start we wanted, but there&rsquo;s time to turn it around. We&rsquo;ll look at where we can make smarter decisions moving forward.&quot;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Ajinkya Rahane | Kolkata Knight Riders Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>&quot;This was a really important win for us, and the margin of victory makes it even more satisfying. We actually wanted to bowl first too, but after losing early wickets, the discussion was about consolidating through the powerplay. The message was simple&mdash;play with intent, but sensible cricket shots. If we kept wickets in hand, our finishers could express themselves later.When Rinku and Venkatesh were at the crease, the talk was to aim for 50-60 runs in the final five overs. We had Dre, Ramandeep, and Moeen padded up and ready to go.We initially thought 170 would be a good total, but thanks to the way Rinku and Venkatesh batted, we got 30 more. We have three top-quality spinners&mdash;Moeen couldn&rsquo;t bowl today, but Sunil and Varun did a brilliant job. Credit to Vaibhav and Harshit as well. Bowling in the powerplay isn&rsquo;t easy, and Vaibhav getting those early breakthroughs set the tone perfectly.&quot;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vaibhav Arora |&nbsp;Player of the Match:<br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#8e44ad\">&quot;I always try to stay prepared. The management lets me know well in advance whether I&rsquo;ll be used as the Impact Player, which helps me mentally gear up for the game. Once I get on the field, I try to read the conditions and adjust my bowling accordingly.During the 5th and 6th overs, there&rsquo;s not much swing, so cutters become very effective, especially tonight as the pitch was gripping. When there&rsquo;s no swing, I also like to mix in a few yorkers to keep the batters guessing.We do detailed planning for each opposition batter in our team meetings, and once we&rsquo;re out there, it&rsquo;s all about execution.Our strategy is clear&mdash;strike early in the powerplay and let our world-class spinners take over after that. We aim to pick 2-3 wickets up front to make their job easier. With bowlers like Sunil and Varun, it gives us a lot of confidence as a unit.&quot;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\n",

      "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>FIRE UP, FOLKS! The M. Chinnaswamy Stadium is locked and loaded for a blockbuster between Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Gujarat Titans. This one&#39;s got spice, bite, and enough drama to keep you on the edge of your seat!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>RCB are walking in with a spring in their step&mdash;two wins on the bounce away from home and the batting is looking red-hot. Virat Kohli and Phil Salt at the top? Absolute dynamite. And Rajat Patidar, wearing the captain&rsquo;s armband, has led with purpose and calm&mdash;runs, decisions, presence, he&#39;s ticking all the boxes.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Now here&rsquo;s the sub-plot. Mohammed Siraj&mdash;seven seasons in RCB colours&mdash;now lining up against them. He knows that ground like the back of his hand. And don&rsquo;t be surprised if there&rsquo;s a little chin music when he runs in to bowl to Kohli. That&rsquo;s a mouth-watering face-off. High-voltage stuff, that.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>On the other side, Gujarat Titans have their own trump cards. Sai Sudharsan&rsquo;s in the form of his life. Shubman Gill and Jos Buttler are due, and when they fire, they don&rsquo;t just knock&mdash;they smash the door down. Middle-order? Still a work in progress, but they&rsquo;ll want to build on that big win over Mumbai.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>And don&rsquo;t forget the venue. The Chinnaswamy isn&rsquo;t just a ground, it&rsquo;s a living, breathing beast. Short boundaries, flat deck&mdash;bowlers, beware. But the tale has a twist: the pitch looks dry and tired. Spinners could come into play. Tactical smarts will count tonight.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>This one&rsquo;s not just two teams&mdash;it&rsquo;s two heavyweights throwing punches. RCB want to stamp their authority at home. GT want to prove they&rsquo;re not just good at home&mdash;they&rsquo;re good anywhere. Buckle up, this could go down to the wire!<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (5)_1743599718.gif\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\nVenue Stats ( Since IPL 2024)&nbsp;<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (3)_1743600449.jpg\" \/>&nbsp;<\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report | Matthew Hayden &amp; Murali Kartik<\/strong><br \/>\n&ldquo;We&rsquo;re on pitch number 6 today, and interestingly, it wasn&rsquo;t used at all last season. The square boundaries measure 68 and 61 metres, while the cover and midwicket boundaries stretch to 74 and 68 metres respectively. The shortest boundary &mdash; third man\/fine leg &mdash; is just 55 metres, with a straight hit at 73 metres. It&rsquo;s a dry surface, but local insights suggest it&rsquo;ll offer decent bounce. There&rsquo;s also a chance of dew later, which is why most teams have preferred chasing here.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s live and evenly spread across the center &mdash; the kind of surface seamers like Hazlewood and Ishant will be licking their lips over. Very firm underneath, and visually, you can spot the blend &mdash; a mix of grey and black clay. While it&rsquo;s dry, it should still play true with good bounce. And with those boundary sizes, especially straight down the ground, batters will fancy themselves if the ball comes on. Historically, the toss hasn&rsquo;t made much of a difference &mdash; only 3 of the last 7 games here were won chasing. Average first-innings score? Around 197. Expect something in that range again today.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (7)_1743602234.gif\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE :<\/strong> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/GT-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:32px\" title=\"\" \/><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&nbsp;Won the Toss and Elected to Field&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

Despite a strong batting effort from Royal Challengers Bangalore, they could only manage 169\/8 in their allotted 20 overs.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>RCB got off to a shaky start, losing Virat Kohli early for just 7. They were further pegged back by Mohammed Siraj&rsquo;s impressive spell, picking up key wickets of Phil Salt (14) and Devdutt Padikkal (4). A valiant effort from Liam Livingstone, who scored 54 off 40 balls, helped steady the ship for RCB. Jitesh Sharma (33) and Tim David (32) also chipped in, but the middle-order collapse meant RCB could only set a modest target of 170.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>In response, Gujarat Titans made light work of the chase, reaching the target in just 17.5 overs. Sudharsan played a crucial role with a composed 49 off 36 balls, while Buttler&rsquo;s explosive 73* from 39 balls guided them to victory. Rutherford&rsquo;s quick-fire 30* (18) further added to the momentum.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\n<strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/Post_1743616619.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Rajat Patidar | RCB Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&nbsp;&quot;We were targeting around 190 after the powerplay, but the early wickets set us back.&nbsp;The intent was right, but ideally, we should&#39;ve only lost one or two wickets in the powerplay. Losing three made a big difference.Our bowlers were exceptional. They put in a lot of hard work, and despite the total not being easy to defend, they did brilliantly, pushing the opposition till the 18th over.After losing those three wickets, the way Jitesh, Tim, and the other batters came in and batted was fantastic. That was a big positive from this match.We&rsquo;re confident in our batting line-up. They&rsquo;re showing great intent, and that&rsquo;s a good sign moving forward for us.&quot;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>Shubman Gill | GT Captain: <\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;Restricting them to 170 on this ground was a solid effort. This pitch can produce anything&mdash;sometimes it can get you to 250, other times it offers something for the bowlers early on. We knew that if we took early wickets, we&#39;d be in the game. It&#39;s disappointing, but you have to keep coming back and grabbing the next opportunity. With the bat, we adapted well to the situation, and that&#39;s what mattered. It&#39;s all about playing smartly according to the conditions.&quot;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>Mohammed Siraj | Player of the Match:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;It was an emotional moment for me, switching from red to blue after spending seven years here. But once I got the ball in my hand, I was fine. As a huge Ronaldo fan, the celebration was for him. I&#39;ve been consistent with my performances, but during the break, I focused on correcting my mistakes and worked on my fitness. When I got picked up by Gujarat Titans, I had a conversation with Ashish Bhai, and Nehra Bhai always tells me to enjoy my bowling. Ishant Bhai helps with my line and length. My mindset is simple&mdash;believe in myself, and the pitch doesn&rsquo;t matter.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n",

      "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>The IPL narrative often pivots on moments of redemption and resilience, and the upcoming match between Lucknow Super Giants <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/LSG-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" \/> and Punjab Kings <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/PK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:54px\" title=\"\" \/> at the Ekana Cricket Stadium perfectly embodies this spirit. Both teams arrive with momentum yet carry distinctly different emotional baggage from their recent performances.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lucknow Super Giants enter the contest with a rollercoaster of emotions behind them. Their recent match against Delhi Capitals was a nail-biting affair that slipped through their fingers, only to be followed by a comprehensive victory against Sunrisers Hyderabad that restored their confidence. The bowling unit, initially struggling without key players Akash Deep and Mayank Yadav, found unexpected heroes in Shardul Thakur and Prince Yadav. Their resurgence couldn&#39;t have come at a better time, especially with the Ekana pitch promising a more bowler-friendly surface.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Punjab Kings, conversely, ride high on the wave of their recent triumph against the Gujarat Titans. Shreyas Iyer&#39;s nearly perfect 97 and the breakthrough performances of Priyansh Arya and Shashank Singh have injected new energy into the squad. Their batting depth looks formidable, though their bowling attack will be tested on a surface that demands precision and strategy.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The match presents a fascinating subtext of individual performances and team dynamics. Nicholas Pooran&#39;s explosive batting for LSG contrasts with Rishabh Pant&#39;s current struggles, while Punjab&#39;s Vyshak Vijaykumar has emerged as a crucial death-over specialist. Mitchell Marsh&#39;s consistent form adds another layer of intrigue to an already complex narrative.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>As the sun sets on the Ekana Stadium, IPLfans can expect nothing less than a thrilling encounter that encapsulates the essence of T20 cricket &ndash; unpredictability, drama, and the potential for individual brilliance to transform a game.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (13)_1743513518.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\nStats At Ekana Stadium:<\/strong><br \/>\nIn 13 matches played at this venue, teams chasing have a slight advantage, winning 7 compared to 6 wins for teams batting first. The average score stands at 166. Pace bowlers have been more effective, taking 61% of the wickets, while spinners account for the remaining 39%.<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (2)_1743514389.jpg\" \/>&nbsp;<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report&nbsp; | Deep Dasgupta and Graeme Swann:<\/strong><br \/>\n&quot;We&rsquo;re set for the first game of the season here in Lucknow, and the match will be played on a <strong>red soil pitch<\/strong>. Known for being a high-scoring venue, this surface offers good <strong>pace and bounce<\/strong>, with nice carry through to the keeper. The ground dimensions provide some relief for bowlers &mdash; it&rsquo;s <strong>70 meters<\/strong> to the right, <strong>64 meters<\/strong> to the left, and <strong>77 meters straight<\/strong> down the ground, which could help contain big hits.The pitch has an <strong>even covering of grass<\/strong>, but there&rsquo;s likely to be <strong>minimal seam or spin movement<\/strong>, making it an excellent surface for batting. It looks absolutely glorious for stroke play, and <strong>chasing might be the smarter option<\/strong> under these conditions.That said, there&rsquo;s a bit of breeze around and while dew is usually expected here, it wasn&rsquo;t present last night. So, while teams may lean toward chasing, <strong>batting first isn&rsquo;t a bad option either<\/strong> depending on strategy and conditions as the game progresses.&quot;<\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (6)_1743514663.gif\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>TOSS: <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/PK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:54px\" title=\"\" \/><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">&nbsp;Won the Toss and Elected to Field&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

Chasing 172, they made light work of the target, breezing to 177\/2 in just 16.2 overs, thanks to a blazing 69 off 34 from Prabhsimran Singh and a captain&rsquo;s knock from Shreyas Iyer.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Electing to bowl first, PBKS got off to a dream start as Arshdeep Singh removed Mitchell Marsh for a golden duck. Despite a counter-attacking 44 from Nicholas Pooran, who hammered 7 boundaries, LSG kept losing wickets at key moments. Ayush Badoni played a gritty hand of 41, and Abdul Samad&rsquo;s late cameo (27 off 12) helped them post a competitive 171\/7. But with Arshdeep (3\/43) and Jansen (1\/28) controlling the pace, LSG couldn&rsquo;t quite shift gears in the death overs.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The chase? Oh, it was a Prabhsimran masterclass! The wicketkeeper-batter unleashed his full range&mdash;lofts, scoops, and signature drives&mdash;bringing up his fifty in just 23 balls. A couple of towering sixes over mid-wicket lit up the Ekana night, before he fell on 69. But PBKS didn&rsquo;t break stride.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Shreyas Iyer, calm and calculated, anchored the chase with an unbeaten 52 off 30, while Impact Player Nehal Wadhera finished things in style with a rollicking 43*. The pair added an unbroken 67-run stand to seal the game with 22 balls to spare.<\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/m13final_1743529445.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Rishabh Pant | LSG Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&ldquo;We were probably 20&ndash;25 runs short, and in a game like this, those runs make a big difference. But that&rsquo;s cricket&mdash;these things happen. We&rsquo;re still getting a feel for the conditions here at our home ground and trying to figure out the best way to approach them.<\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Losing early wickets never helps when you&rsquo;re aiming for a big total, but credit to the boys&mdash;everyone&rsquo;s putting in the effort and trying to push the game forward. The plan was to prepare a slightly slower pitch, and I think we got that. The slower balls were definitely gripping and sticking a bit, but we couldn&rsquo;t capitalize enough with the bat.<\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">We&rsquo;ve got to take the learnings from this match and keep moving forward. There are a lot of positives to take despite the loss&mdash;we just need to tighten a few areas and come back stronger in the next game.&rdquo;<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>Shreyas Iyer | PBKS Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">&ldquo;This is exactly the kind of start we needed. The boys executed their roles brilliantly&mdash;everyone contributed in their own way, and what we spoke about in the team meeting was implemented to perfection on the field.<\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Honestly, there&rsquo;s no fixed formula or &lsquo;right combination&rsquo; in T20s. What matters most is the camaraderie and the synergy among players&mdash;when that clicks, the results follow. Every team in this tournament has the potential to win; it&rsquo;s about bringing that unified mindset into each game.<\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">As for me, I try to stay in the present and not get caught up in what&rsquo;s already done. Even this innings is history now&mdash;I&rsquo;m already looking ahead and focusing on the next challenge.&rdquo;<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Prabhsimran Singh | Player of the Match:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&ldquo;Everyone knows what a legend he is&mdash;having someone like Ricky Ponting as coach is a huge boost. He&rsquo;s always incredibly positive. He doesn&rsquo;t dwell on the &#39;what-ifs&#39; and keeps reminding us to back our natural game.<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Those sweeps and switch hits?

      "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Wankhede Stadium gears up for its IPL 2025 debut as the struggling Mumbai Indians (MI) host defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in Match 12 on Monday, March 31.MI, winless after two games, return home under pressure. Despite Hardik Pandya&rsquo;s return as captain, they fell short against Gujarat Titans. Mumbai&rsquo;s top order &mdash; Rohit Sharma, Ryan Rickelton, and Tilak Varma &mdash; have failed to fire, while the bowling lacks bite without Jasprit Bumrah. Selection confusion has also plagued MI, with in-form spinner Vignesh Puthur left out in the last game despite an impressive outing against CSK.KKR, meanwhile, bounced back strongly with a win over Rajasthan Royals. Quinton de Kock&rsquo;s unbeaten 97 and Moeen Ali&rsquo;s economical spell (2\/23) stood out. The good news for KKR is Sunil Narine&rsquo;s return, setting up a potent spin duo with Varun Chakaravarthy to trouble MI&rsquo;s shaky batting.Wankhede&rsquo;s true bounce and short boundaries should favour big hitters like Andre Russell, while early swing might offer opportunities to pacers like Trent Boult and Spencer Johnson. Dew isn&rsquo;t expected to play a major role, but both teams could still prefer chasing.KKR ended a 12-year winless streak at Wankhede last season and have won five of their last six encounters against MI. With MI facing questions around form and strategy, KKR enter this clash with a slight edge.Will Mumbai finally click at their fortress, or will KKR add to their woes?&nbsp;<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (12)_1743428281.gif\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report:- <\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Eoin Morgan:<\/strong> &quot;We&rsquo;re in for a run-fest on what looks like a batting beauty.

Ashwani Kumar produced a dream spell, picking up 4 for 24, dismantling the middle order with sharp, intelligent pace bowling.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Only Angkrish Raghuvanshi (26 off 16) and Ramandeep Singh (22 off 12) showed brief resistance, but wickets fell regularly, and the Knight Riders were eventually bundled out for 116 in just 16.2 overs.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>In reply, Rohit Sharma gave MI a brisk start before falling to Russell, but Rickelton and Suryakumar Yadav (27 off 9) ensured there were no hiccups. SKY was in sublime touch, hammering three fours and two sixes at a strike rate of 300 to wrap things up in style.&nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/mivkkr_1743504998.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\nAjinkya Rahane | KKR Captain:<br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#8e44ad\">&quot;It was a collective batting failure for us. As I mentioned at the toss, it was a good wicket to bat on. A score of 180-190 would have been ideal, but we suffered a collective batting failure.At Wankhede, with extra pace and bounce, sometimes you need to use the wicket&#39;s characteristics. We need to recover fast from this game. The bowlers tried their best, but there just weren&#39;t enough runs on the board.We kept losing wickets &mdash; four in the powerplay &mdash; and failed to build momentum. We needed a partnership, one batsman to stay till the end, but that didn&#39;t happen for us tonight.&quot;&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Hardik Pandya | MI Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;A deeply satisfying victory, especially at home. The way everyone contributed was remarkable. Selecting standout performers is always challenging with our talented squad. Our scouts have been instrumental, scouting far and wide to discover exceptional talent like Ashwani. During our practice match, we noticed his extra swing as a left-arm bowler and potential for death-over bowling.His impact was immediate &ndash; taking Quinton&#39;s catch and then dismissing Russell, which was a crucial breakthrough. It&#39;s inspiring to see young players seizing their opportunities and building confidence. We have a fantastic blend of youth and experience, and this win represents a promising start to our tournament. Seeing young talents like Ashwani step up and &#39;come into the party&#39; is exactly what makes this team special.&quot;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Ashwani Kumar | Player Of The Match:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;This is truly special for me. Winning Player of the Match in my first outing is beyond my expectations. I had confidence, but I&#39;d be lying if I said there weren&#39;t nerves before stepping onto the field. My commitment moving forward is simple: in every match I play, I want to make my family, fans, and Mumbai Indians proud.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n",

      "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>The IPL 2025 caravan rolls into Guwahati for Sunday&#39;s evening fixture as the Rajasthan Royals host the Chennai Super Kings at the Barsapara Cricket Stadium. Both former champions enter this contest with plenty to prove after contrasting starts to their campaigns.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Rajasthan, still searching for their first victory after two matches, will look to harness home advantage despite their historically mixed results at this venue. Captain Riyan Parag returns to familiar territory in Assam, where his local knowledge could prove invaluable on a surface that showed considerable assistance to spinners in Wednesday&#39;s fixture. The Royals&#39; batting showed tremendous potential against Hyderabad, posting 242 in a spirited chase. Their challenge now lies in finding the right balance with their overseas selections, particularly in the bowling department, where they have several options to consider.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Chennai arrives with minimal recovery time following their Friday encounter against RCB at Chepauk. The Lions started brightly with a victory over Mumbai but will be eager to bounce back immediately. Their experienced squad knows how to navigate the ebbs and flows of a lengthy tournament. The tactical battle between these sides presents fascinating subplots. Will Ruturaj Gaikwad revert to his opening position? How will Chennai&#39;s spin-heavy attack fare on this helpful surface? Can the Royals&#39; batting lineup find consistency against CSK&#39;s varied bowling options ?Adding spice to the encounter are the players facing their former teams &ndash; Tushar Deshpande now represents Rajasthan after his stint with Chennai, while Shivam Dube faces his former Rajasthan teammates.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>As floodlights illuminate the picturesque Barsapara Stadium, expect a compelling contest between two sides with championship pedigree looking to build momentum in what promises to be another fiercely competitive IPL season.&nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (11)_1743339826.gif\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Daren Ganga &amp; Shane Watson: <\/strong>&ldquo;Side boundaries are short &mdash; 63 metres and 66 metres &mdash; with 78 metres straight down the ground. The surface looks quite similar to the other night. There&rsquo;s a bit of sheen, but make no mistake, it&rsquo;s dry underneath. Expect the spinners to come into play through the middle overs &mdash; that&rsquo;ll be the key phase, especially with the quality on display from both sides. It&rsquo;s not one of those flat 200-run wickets, but still plenty in it for bat and ball. Conditions are set for a cracking contest tonight.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (4)_1743342990.gif\" \/><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS UPDATE:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>CSK WON THE TOSS AND ELECTED TO BOWL FIRST!&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

However, Nitish Rana stole the show with a blazing 81 off just 36 balls, launching 10 fours and 5 sixes in a carnage that revived the innings. Sanju Samson provided early momentum, while Riyan Parag (37 off 28) anchored the middle overs. Despite losing wickets in a heap at the back end, RR managed a competitive 182\/9, thanks to Rana&rsquo;s fireworks and Parag&rsquo;s handy knock.For CSK, Khaleel Ahmed (2\/38), Pathirana (2\/28), and Noor Ahmad (2\/28) were clinical, regularly picking wickets to keep RR in check.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Chasing 183, CSK had a shaky start, losing Rachin Ravindra for a duck. Ruturaj Gaikwad stood tall, crafting a classy 63 off 44, ably supported by Dube and Jadeja. But the real twist came in the middle overs, where Wanindu Hasaranga spun a web, claiming 4 wickets for 35, including key scalps of Tripathi, Dube, Shankar, and Gaikwad &mdash; three of them after being hit for a six the previous ball!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>CSK were still in the hunt with Dhoni and Jadeja at the crease, but a stunning catch from Hetmyer to dismiss Dhoni and a tight final over by Sandeep Sharma sealed the deal. Overton&#39;s late six threatened a heist, but it wasn&#39;t to be.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong><br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/rrvcsk_1743504857.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Ruturaj Gaikwad | Chennai Super Kings Captain:<br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#d35400\">&quot;In the powerplay, Nitish batted exceptionally well, but we weren&#39;t proactive enough. He was consistently finding runs behind square, and we should have adjusted our field quicker. In games like these, it&#39;s often about one big hit &mdash; and we were just one hit away from crossing the line.We gave away 8&ndash;10 runs through misfields, and that&#39;s an area we need to clean up. It&rsquo;s costing us games. That said, 180 was definitely a chaseable total on this wicket. It was a good surface to bat on, especially if you timed the ball well.At one stage, they looked set for 220&ndash;230, so I was happy with how we pulled it back. Historically, we&#39;ve had Ajinkya at No. 3 and Rayudu stabilizing the middle order. So we decided I&rsquo;d shift down a spot, and Rahul (Tripathi) &mdash; who&rsquo;s known for his aggressive starts &mdash; could express himself freely. Not much of a change really, since I&rsquo;m still walking in during the first or second over (smiles).There have been no discussions yet about changing that plan &mdash; it was something agreed upon during the auction. Personally, I&rsquo;m comfortable playing any role &mdash; rotating strike or taking risks when needed &mdash; especially with someone like Shivam at the other end.We haven&#39;t had the best starts so far, but once we get that rhythm at the top, our batting unit will click. There were a lot of positives today &mdash; Noor continues to bowl brilliantly, Khaleel&rsquo;s hitting his lengths, and Jaddu bhai was excellent. We just need that one breakthrough to build pressure. Once our fielding tightens up, we&rsquo;ll be a very dangerous side.&quot;&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Riyan Parag | Rajasthan Royals Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#ff0066\"><strong>&quot;(On the first win as captain) Took just two games, but honestly, it felt a lot longer than that! We still believe we were about 20 runs short today &mdash; we lost a couple of wickets in the middle which slowed us down. But credit to the bowlers, they did an outstanding job defending that total.After two tough outings, our chat was simple &mdash; forget the past, reset, and come out with a fresh mindset. Everyone responded really well.(On not completing Archer&#39;s spell) It was a situational call. Thankfully, we had seven bowling options and went with what felt right at the time. And that fielding effort &mdash; top-notch! We&rsquo;ve been working hard with Dishant Yagnik, our fielding coach, and the results are showing. It made up for the runs we felt we left on the table.&quot;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Nitish Rana | Player of the Match:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#ff0066\"><strong>&quot;I wanted to take full advantage of the new ball in the powerplay &mdash; that phase is key because once the ball gets older, it slows down and starts gripping. My aim was to play the field rather than focus too much on the bowler or pitch.Whenever fine leg or third man was up, I tried using the pace to place it in those gaps. In the previous two games, I was trying to hit the ball too hard. Today, I focused more on timing and placement &mdash; and it worked.&nbsp;It was a tactical decision from the coaches. I&rsquo;m happy to bat wherever the team needs me. At No. 4, I was over-hitting, and Riyan was doing something similar at three. So we swapped roles, and thankfully it clicked tonight.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n",

      "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>The IPL 2025 carnival continues with Delhi Capitals welcoming Sunrisers Hyderabad to their adopted home in Vizag this Sunday afternoon. Both teams enter this clash with contrasting emotions but similar 1-1 records, setting the stage for an explosive encounter at Dr. Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy ACA-VDCA Cricket Stadium.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Delhi&#39;s heroic one-wicket heist against LSG, where they chased down 210 from a seemingly impossible position of 65\/5, has injected tremendous belief into Axar Patel&#39;s men. The star of that victory, Ashutosh Sharma, embodied their fearless approach with his match-winning 66 off just 31 balls, dedicated to team mentor Kevin Pietersen with an imaginary switch-hit celebration. Their bowling attack, spearheaded by Mitchell Starc and Kuldeep Yadav, will face its sternest test against SRH&#39;s destructive batting lineup. Starc, in particular, holds a psychological edge over Travis Head, having dismissed the Australian opener cheaply in last season&#39;s Qualifier 1.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The Sunrisers arrive in Vizag, smarting from a rare batting misfire at home. After setting new benchmarks for aggressive batting with 286 against the Rajasthan Royals, they were brought back to earth by LSG, managing &quot;only&quot; 190 despite late fireworks from Aniket Verma and Pat Cummins.DC received a significant boost with KL Rahul&#39;s return after missing the opener due to the birth of his child. His experience will strengthen a top order that faltered badly against LSG, with no batsman in the top five crossing 30. With its shorter square boundaries, the picturesque Vizag stadium has been a batter&#39;s paradise, with recent first-innings scores of 191, 272, and 209. This venue perfectly suits both teams&#39; aggressive batting philosophies. As SRH&#39;s &quot;Travishek&quot; opening duo looks to rebound and DC&#39;s lower order hopes to build on their match-winning momentum, cricket fans can expect another high-scoring thriller in what has become one of the IPL&#39;s most entertaining matchups.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (9)_1743326489.gif\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Danny Morrison:<\/strong> &quot;A bright sunny day greets us here, and we&rsquo;re set for some high-octane action. The dimensions first - square boundaries are 66m and 60m, while straight down the ground is 73m. Short enough for the big hitters to fancy their chances. Now to the pitch &mdash; it&rsquo;s a hybrid with black soil on top and red soil underneath, which means early on, batters could dominate with true bounce and pace. But don&rsquo;t be surprised if spinners come into play later in the innings. Expect runs early, but keep an eye on the grip and turn as the surface wears in.&quot;&nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (32)_1743327655.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS UPDATE:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>Pat Cummins calls right, and <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/SRH-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" \/> opts to bat first!&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

Didn&rsquo;t put enough runs on the board. A few poor shot selections, and yes, those catches in the deep &mdash; they&rsquo;re part and parcel of T20 cricket, but they do hurt when you&#39;re trying to build momentum. Not a massive margin in the end. On another day, a couple of those shots come off, and the game swings differently. Just wasn&rsquo;t our day. We&rsquo;ll go back, reflect on a few decisions &mdash; both with the bat and ball &mdash; and look at our options. Pleased with Aniket Verma, though. Even before the tournament started, he impressed everyone in the lead-up. What we saw in practice, he brought into the game today. Gave us a genuine chance and showed maturity. It&#39;s still early. Two losses, yes, but nothing to panic about. We regroup, we rethink, and we move forward.&rdquo;<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Axar Patel, DC Captain:<\/strong><\/span>&nbsp;&quot;I&rsquo;ve said it before &mdash; I&rsquo;m going to lead this side with the same mindset every game. In a tournament like this, you can&rsquo;t take any opposition lightly. All 10 teams are quality. Today we stuck to our plans, our processes, and executed really well, which made the difference. The original idea was to give Starc two overs upfront and hold two back for the death. But he was in great rhythm &mdash; I felt he could break the game open &mdash; so I gave him a third, and he got us a big wicket. That proved crucial. &quot;We&rsquo;ve got experienced players who constantly feed in suggestions &mdash; sometimes I take them, sometimes I back my gut. But I enjoy leading this group. Looking ahead to Kotla &mdash; it&rsquo;s a venue we know well. The key will be assessing the surface quickly and adapting. The plans will stay clear; it&rsquo;s all about execution.&quot;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Mitchell Starc, Player of the Match:<\/strong><\/span>&nbsp;&quot;It&rsquo;s been a good day &ndash; with the ball, in the field, and with the bat as well. A complete team performance, and I&rsquo;m glad I could contribute to the win.&nbsp;Batters are smarter, matchups are well-known &ndash; so you&rsquo;ve got to think outside the box. Tried to mix it up a bit today, and it worked well. As a senior player, that&rsquo;s the challenge &ndash; keep evolving. You can&rsquo;t just go through the motions anymore. Great energy, great bunch to be around. Looking forward to building more momentum from here.&quot;<\/p>\n",

However, their death bowling was brutally exposed, with only R Sai Kishore emerging with respectable figures. Captain Shubman Gill might consider strengthening their pace attack with Ishant Sharma or Gerald Coetzee waiting in the wings.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Mumbai&#39;s batting collapsed in Chennai, managing only 155 against CSK. Rohit Sharma&#39;s four-ball duck set the tone, with Tilak Varma and Suryakumar Yadav unable to capitalize on starts. The silver lining was Vignesh Puthur&#39;s impressive three-wicket haul on debut. The world&#39;s largest cricket stadium traditionally offers batting-friendly conditions, with dew likely to favor the chasing team. Six of eight IPL games played here last season were won by teams batting second. History favors the home side &ndash; Mumbai have never won an IPL match at this venue in three attempts against Gujarat. As Pandya returns to his former hunting ground, both teams know early-season momentum is at stake in what promises to be a fascinating battle under the Ahmedabad lights.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (8)_1743254229.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report |&nbsp;Nick Knight and&nbsp;Michael Clarke<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re back in Ahmedabad, and it&rsquo;s game two at this colossal venue.

Batting and bowling, we were 15-20 short. There were errors. We were not professionals in the field. That cost us 20-25 runs, which is a lot in T20 cricket. Gill and Sudharsan batted brilliantly. We bowled well, and there were some balls here and there but otherwise, the way they batted was exceptional. They didn&rsquo;t take chances. They hit boundaries. Without taking high risks, they hit boundaries, and we were left with catching up. There shouldn&rsquo;t be a concern. But I think we have to take responsibility. Batters will have to join the party, and hopefully, they&#39;ll join in soon.I was just thinking that I bowled too many slower balls. They saw that the ball was gripping, and those were the toughest balls to face and some were shooting low. It makes life difficult for the batters, and they used them well.&quot;&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#000000\">Shubman Gill | Gujarat Titans Captain:<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#000066\">&quot;I think yeah, the decision was taken before we played the first match that we will be playing the second match on a black soil wicket. Yeah, that was also another factor. I feel this wicket also suits our batting and as you can see, it worked out well for us.<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"color:#000066\"><strong>That&#39;s one of the factors batting on a black soil wicket. Once the ball gets old, it&#39;s difficult to clear the boundary. We discussed it in the team meeting that we will maximize the powerplay.<\/strong><strong>I think we can all talk about the plan but at the end if you get the desired result, all the things seem to be in place.<\/strong><strong>I don&#39;t know maybe, this could be the first time that he has bowled only 2 overs for us in a match. I actually kept his overs to bowl at the end but with the way the fast bowlers were bowling, I just didn&#39;t want to bring him back in. Prasidh bowled beautifully so I thought why not continue with him.<\/strong><strong>Yeah, we have seen the par score on those wickets so we are looking forward to our next two away games.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Prasidh Krishna | Player of the Match <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" \/> :<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<strong><span style=\"color:#000066\">&quot;Nothing much to be honest. I don&#39;t have many words to say. I was itching to bowl. It was till the 10th over. I didn&#39;t have to wait so long ever to bowl in a T20.Well, we were sitting on top and watching how things went in the first innings. We observed that pace off and cutters were working well. We knew that into the wicket was the way to go.I just figured that was working, so I did not want to test the speed gun. I wanted to keep things simple; every single ball was important.&quot;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n",

Both teams enter this contest with winning momentum after successful opening games.The last time these teams met produced high drama with RCB&#39;s Yash Dayal defending 10 runs in the final over against MS Dhoni to secure a playoff berth. The wild celebrations at Chinnaswamy Stadium that night have only intensified this rivalry.Chennai holds historical dominance with a commanding 22-11 overall record against RCB, including an overwhelming 8-1 advantage at Chepauk. RCB&#39;s lone victory in Chennai came way back in 2008, the inaugural IPL season.CSK opened their campaign with a tense victory over Mumbai Indians, thanks to their spin trio of Noor Ahmad (4\/18), Ravindra Jadeja, and R Ashwin who strangled MI&#39;s batting. Rachin Ravindra&#39;s steady batting sealed the chase in the final over.RCB, meanwhile, conquered defending champions KKR at Eden Gardens. Phil Salt (56) and Virat Kohli (59*) set the platform with a blazing 95-run opening stand, before captain Rajat Patidar&#39;s quickfire 34 finished the job with 22 balls to spare. Josh Hazlewood and Krunal Pandya starred with the ball.The Chepauk pitch presents a significant tactical battle. RCB&#39;s batting lineup, built primarily for pace-friendly conditions, may struggle against CSK&#39;s world-class spin attack. Only captain Patidar among RCB&#39;s top eight batters has a better strike rate against spin than pace.Conversely, RCB&#39;s spin attack &ndash; featuring Krunal Pandya, an inexperienced Suyash Sharma, and part-time options &ndash; could be vulnerable against CSK&#39;s four left-handed batters. However, early-season Chennai pitches might not yet have developed their traditional spin-friendly characteristics.Bhuvneshwar Kumar might return for RCB after missing the opener with a minor injury, while CSK&#39;s Matheesha Pathirana remains doubtful for the second consecutive game.This clash transcends cricket as it represents neighboring states with passionate fan bases, both worshipping cricket icons who aren&#39;t native to their regions. Though CSK start as favorites at home, RCB&#39;s new-found confidence makes this battle too close to call.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (7)_1743165968.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>VENUE STATS:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Teams batting first have had an advantage here in the past, winning 50 of the 87 games played here in the IPL, with the highest score being 246 and the average 1st innings score being 164.

It wasn&rsquo;t the easiest pitch to bat on, and we had a bad day in the field. When you&rsquo;re chasing 20 extra runs on a sticky surface, the approach in the powerplay changes. You try to be a step ahead, but sometimes it just doesn&rsquo;t come off.

The clash pits last year&#39;s finalists against a completely overhauled LSG side under new captain Rishabh Pant.SRH characteristically began their IPL 2025 campaign, hammering 286 runs against Rajasthan Royals, with Ishan Kishan smashing an unbeaten 106 off just 47 balls. Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma provided the explosive start that has become their trademark, as all six top-order batters struck at 200+ strike rates.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lucknow, meanwhile, suffered a heartbreaking defeat against Delhi Capitals, failing to defend 209 despite being in commanding positions multiple times. The Rishabh Pant era began with promise but ended in disappointment, as their revamped bowling attack couldn&#39;t close out the game.&nbsp;<\/strong><strong>Despite their batting dominance, SRH&#39;s bowling showed vulnerability against Rajasthan.LSG&#39;s bowling worries are more acute with a makeshift attack that features just two specialist pacers. While Ravi Bishnoi and Shardul Thakur bring international experience, they struggled in the opener. The visitors have Avesh Khan joining the squad, but may also consider introducing Caribbean speedster Shamar Joseph.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>LSG&#39;s top order, featuring Mitchell Marsh and Nicholas Pooran, who made impactful contributions against DC, possesses the firepower to match SRH at this venue. However, they&#39;ll need more from Aiden Markram, Pant, and Ayush Badoni, who failed to leave a mark in their opener. The Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium&#39;s surface remains a batter&#39;s paradise. The previous game here saw a staggering match aggregate of 528 runs, and today&#39;s encounter promises more of the same under lights.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Despite SRH&#39;s dominance in their last encounter, LSG holds a 3-1 advantage in their overall IPL head-to-head record. At this venue, the teams have split their two previous meetings. As the Orange Army aims for back-to-back victories to solidify their early-season momentum, the Super Giants will be desperate to get their first points on the board and prove that their new era under Pant has genuine promise.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (4)_1743082349.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report | Deep Dasgupta:<\/strong><br \/>\n&quot;Welcome to Hyderabad, where runs have flowed like water in 2024. This season, we&rsquo;ve seen an average of 24 sixes per game, and the last match here dished out 30 sixes and a mind-boggling 528 runs. You might think it&#39;s down to short boundaries&mdash;but hold on! It&#39;s 69 meters to the right, 67 to the left, and 79 straight down&mdash;so it&rsquo;s not the size of the ground. The magic is in the pitch.Tonight, we&rsquo;re on a fresh surface&mdash;unlike the last game&rsquo;s strip, which had a hint of grass. This one? Barren. Bare. Not a blade of grass. It&rsquo;s firm, and you can hear it when you tap it. But look closely&mdash;there are minor abrasions and tiny cracks around the good length areas. Not alarming, but something to keep an eye on. The ball might grip a touch or slow down as it gets older.It&#39;s a red-soil wicket, so expect bounce and carry, especially early. But bowlers beware&mdash;there&rsquo;s no dew expected, just like the last game. That means bat first, go hard, and aim for that 200-plus mark. We might not hit 300 tonight&mdash;but trust me, there are plenty of fireworks in store!&quot;<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (4)_1743083956.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE:<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/LSG-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp; Won the Toss and Elected to Field&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

Nicholas Pooran unleashed fury with 70 off just 26 balls. Mitchell Marsh matched him with 52 off 31, their 113-run partnership crushing SRH&#39;s hopes.Though LSG lost a few quick wickets afterward, Abdul Samad (22* off 8) applied the finishing touches against his former team. The victory marks LSG&#39;s first points under new captain Rishabh Pant and delivers a reality check to Hyderabad&#39;s explosive batting lineup.With this impressive performance, Lucknow not only win but significantly boost their net run rate early in the tournament.&nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/image (8)_1743098113.png\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pat Cummins | Sunrisers Hyderabad Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>&quot;Yeah, it was a different wicket tonight. The key is always to show up with a positive mindset, and credit to them &mdash; they played well.It was still a good pitch. The one the other night was probably the best wicket in the world &mdash; tonight&rsquo;s was the second-best! But yeah, the cutters were gripping a little more today. Every game&rsquo;s a fresh start. I thought we bowled alright &mdash; they just had better plans and executed them well. Losing Ishan and Klaasen early hurt our momentum, but getting up to 190 was still a decent effort.Ideally, you want someone batting through the innings like Ishan did last game. But credit to their bowlers, they kept the pressure on.We&rsquo;ve got a deep batting line-up. The message to the guys is &mdash; if you&#39;re in, go for it. We&rsquo;re not asking anyone to bat 60 balls, but to back themselves and go hard.We&rsquo;ll review this game, look at the one or two moments where we could&rsquo;ve done better &mdash; that&rsquo;s usually the difference in T20s. But like I said last time, we won&rsquo;t get too high or too low.

We looked at the positives from the last match and executed much better tonight.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a concern, but we&rsquo;re trying to focus only on what we can control. That&rsquo;s something my mentor always reminds me.The idea was to give him freedom. We know what he&rsquo;s capable of &mdash; if he gets going, it changes games quickly. The environment&rsquo;s been good. Everyone&rsquo;s training hard. We haven&rsquo;t played our best cricket yet, but we&rsquo;re taking it one match at a time and learning with each game.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Shardul Thakur| Player of the Match&nbsp;:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;Honestly,&nbsp; I wasn&rsquo;t expecting a late IPL call. I was preparing to play county cricket if things didn&rsquo;t work out. During the Ranji Trophy, I got a call from Zaheer Khan saying I might be picked as a replacement and if I came in, I&rsquo;d start. That moment brought the IPL mindset back. The auction didn&rsquo;t go my way, but I never gave up. Skills are there &ndash; it&rsquo;s about staying in the moment.With the new ball, the plan was simple &ndash; go full and look for swing. We know Abhishek and Head love to go hard, so I thought why not take my chances too? You can pick wickets early if the ball swings. Their top order&rsquo;s been doing the bulk of the scoring at this venue, so we knew that was the moment to strike.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n",

Both teams are coming off defeats and desperate to get on the board!The Royals were HAMMERED by Sunrisers, conceding a massive 286 runs with Jofra Archer&#39;s most expensive spell in IPL history! BUT DON&#39;T COUNT THEM OUT! Samson&#39;s explosive 66 and Jurel&#39;s fearless 70 showed this team can PUNCH BACK! KKR&#39;s middle order crumbled against RCB&#39;s spinners despite Rahane&#39;s elegant fifty and Narine&#39;s fireworks! Will they unleash Rinku Singh higher up the order? GAME-CHANGER! The Barsapara pitch is a BATTING BEAUTY! Three 190+ scores already here in IPL history and today could see the first 200+ total at this venue! Watch for Nitish Rana facing his old franchise and the FASCINATING battle between KKR&#39;s mystery spinners and Rajasthan&#39;s power hitters!

Let&rsquo;s jump straight into the dimensions: it&rsquo;s 76 meters down the ground, with square boundaries measuring 64 meters on either side &mdash; so fairly balanced, no real bias for the captains to consider. The Royals went with just one specialist spinner in their last game here.&nbsp;Just looking at the surface, it&rsquo;s quite dry, and there isn&rsquo;t much grass cover, especially away from the central strip near the crease. That&rsquo;s a clear sign. Since 2021, the average first-innings score here in T20s is 163, which tells us the pitch tends to slow down slightly. And, importantly, teams batting first have won six out of seven matches at this venue. So, expect the surface to dry out further &mdash; and expect spin to have a real impact tonight.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE:&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/KKR-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp; <span style=\"color:#8e44ad\">Won the Toss and Elected to Field&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

Chasing a modest 152, de Kock remained unbeaten on 97 off just 61 balls, smashing 8 fours and 6 sixes in a masterclass of clean hitting. Despite Moeen Ali falling cheaply for 5 and Rahane departing for 18, KKR never looked under pressure. Young Angkrish Raghuvanshi gave solid support with an unbeaten 22, but it was all about QDK, who launched Theekshana, Archer, and Hasaranga into the stands with ease. He was unbeaten on 97* &mdash; no century, but no regrets either. opened the innings, carried his bat, and handed Kolkata Knight Riders their first win of the season. A proper statement from the left-hander! Earlier in the evening, Rajasthan Royals stumbled to 151\/9 &mdash; the lowest first-innings total this IPL. After a brisk start in the powerplay, they lost momentum quickly. From 67\/1, they collapsed to 82\/5, with Moeen Ali (2\/23) and Varun Chakaravarthy (2\/17) choking the middle overs. Riyan Parag&rsquo;s 25 and Jurel&rsquo;s 33 were the only bright spots. Spencer Johnson was expensive, but Arora and Harshit picked two wickets apiece. Jofra Archer leaked 33 in just 2.3 overs, and Hasaranga struggled with the ball. The Royals were sloppy, with fielding errors compounding their problems.KKR finished it off in just 17.3 overs. Statement made.

The plan initially was to get Quinny early, but once that didn&rsquo;t happen, we shifted our focus to trying to contain them through the middle overs.Last season, the team wanted me to bat at No. 4 and I embraced that role. This time, it&#39;s No. 3, and as a professional, I&rsquo;m happy to adapt to what the team needs.We&rsquo;ll take the learnings from this game, make sure we don&rsquo;t repeat the same mistakes, and aim to come out with a fresh mindset when we face CSK.&quot;<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Ajinkya Rahane | Kolkata Knight Riders Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>&quot;The first six overs were really important and I think we bowled brilliantly during that phase&mdash;conceding just about 40-44 runs and picking up crucial wickets. The middle overs were key too, and that&rsquo;s exactly what we had spoken about before the game. Moeen Ali, coming in for his first match, stepped up big time alongside Varun. Unfortunately, Sunil Narine wasn&#39;t well, but Moeen grabbed his chance and made it count.In this format, you want your players to go out and play fearless cricket. Our batting unit is full of explosive players&mdash;guys who&rsquo;ve done it for the team before. We just focus on giving them the freedom to express themselves. Credit also goes to our bowlers. Moeen&rsquo;s mindset was clear&mdash;he wanted wickets, and that&#39;s exactly what he went after.As for Moeen&rsquo;s role, we gave him complete freedom. He&rsquo;s a quality player, and with his experience of opening in the past, it was a great chance for him to go out there and play his natural game. Very pleased with his contribution.For us, it&rsquo;s about staying in the moment. Whether we win or lose, the focus is always on learning and bouncing back stronger in the next game.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Quinton de Kock | Player of the Match&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" \/> :&nbsp;<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>&quot;Felt good to get the opportunity and glad I could make it count. After retiring from international cricket, to be honest, I haven&rsquo;t faced too many challenges yet. Had a nice three-month break and only about a 10-day prep before the season started, so I came in fresh.<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>It&rsquo;s just my second game here, so I&rsquo;ve been trying to keep things simple&mdash;read the pitch, watch how the ball&rsquo;s behaving, and play the situation. IPL is known for big sixes and huge totals, but today wasn&rsquo;t that kind of game. It was about playing smart and getting the job done.<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>As for joining KKR, it&rsquo;s been a great experience. I really enjoy new environments and meeting new people. Sometimes it takes time for a team to welcome you in, but here at KKR, they&rsquo;ve embraced me from the get-go&mdash;it feels good.<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>There wasn&rsquo;t really a talk about NRR. With the way the pitch played&mdash;turning and stopping&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t the right surface to force that kind of game. It was more of a grafting wicket. Maybe if we get a better surface, that&rsquo;s a conversation for another day. Tonight, it was just about finishing the chase.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n",

      "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Tonight&#39;s showdown at Narendra Modi Stadium is more than just another IPL fixture &ndash; it&#39;s a collision of contrasting cricket narratives. Gujarat aren&#39;t just a team; they&#39;re a winning machine.<strong> With Shubman Gill at the helm, they&#39;ve got a squad that screams championship DNA. The big-ticket acquisition of Jos Buttler adds serious firepower to an already lethal lineup. <\/strong>Throw in Rashid Khan&#39;s magic and new bowling weapons like Kagiso Rabada and Mohammed Siraj, and you&#39;ve got a nightmare matchup for any opposition. Punjab Kings are the perennial underdogs with a star-studded reset. <strong>Shreyas Iyer&#39;s leadership and Ricky Ponting&#39;s<\/strong> <strong>coaching <\/strong>create a potent mix of aggression and strategy. With Glenn Maxwell and Marcus Stoinis in the middle order, they&#39;ve got match-winners who can turn games on their head. Yuzvendra Chahal&#39;s spin and Lockie Ferguson&#39;s pace add serious international class. <strong>Narendra Modi Stadium is no ordinary ground. Last season saw dramatic shifts &ndash; teams bundled out for under 100 or sailing past 199. <\/strong>The&nbsp;Gujarat Titans look more settled, but in the IPL, never write off an underdog. <strong>Punjab Kings aren&#39;t just playing to compete but to prove a point. Buckle up for a cracker of a match.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (3)_1742908550.gif\" \/>&nbsp;<\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report | Matthew Hayden &amp; Eoin Morgan<\/strong><br \/>\n&quot;We&rsquo;re standing on pitch number six today, and it&rsquo;s an absolute beauty. This is a relatively compact ground &mdash; just 64 meters to my left, 66 meters to my right, and 72 meters straight down the ground.&nbsp;Morgs, what&rsquo;s your take on tonight&rsquo;s surface? This pitch looks pristine &mdash; a lovely even covering of grass which is always a sign of consistent bounce. From my experience, when it looks this good at this venue, there&rsquo;s little for batters to fear. If the ball comes on nicely, expect plenty of boundaries cleared tonight.The stats back that up too. The average first-innings score here is 185, and we&rsquo;ve seen teams cross 200 in 10 of the last 17 games. Dew is expected later tonight, so if you win the toss.You absolutely chase. That&rsquo;s the advantage here. But even if you&rsquo;re sent in to bat first, don&rsquo;t panic &mdash; this surface is a batter&rsquo;s paradise. Get ahead early and keep pushing. Either way, it&rsquo;s a high-scoring contest in the making.&quot;<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS UPDATE: <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/GT-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:32px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Won the Toss and Elected to Field&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

Dropping those chances definitely hurt us, and chasing a target like that was always going to be tough.There was a crucial phase in the middle where we only managed around 18 runs in three overs. Even at the start, we didn&rsquo;t get going &mdash; scored just about 30-40 in the first three overs. That patch probably cost us in the end. Still, I&rsquo;d say there were a lot of positives for us to take, and it&rsquo;s a good starting point for the season&nbsp;It&rsquo;s never easy coming in cold as an impact player after sitting for 15-16 overs and executing yorkers under pressure. Full credit to him and the others for the way they bowled at the death.This is always a high-scoring ground. You might post 230 or even 240 here, but the real challenge is in defending it. That&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;ll need to address moving forward.&quot;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Shreyas Iyer | Punjab Kings Captain &amp; Player of the Match:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;Ecstatic, to be honest. Getting 97* in the first match &mdash; that&rsquo;s just the icing on the cake. There&rsquo;s no better feeling. For me, it was all about adapting quickly. That first boundary off the first ball gave me a massive confidence boost. And that flicked six off Rabada &mdash; I feel like that&rsquo;s when the momentum shifted in our favor.There was a bit of extra bounce early on, but we adapted really well. Shashank&rsquo;s knock &mdash; 44 off just 16 or 17 balls &mdash; was incredible. With the dew setting in, we knew the conditions would tilt slightly, so it was all about execution, and I&rsquo;m glad we did that.Vyshak is such a character &mdash; funny, but with a brilliant attitude. He brings great energy, and it was fantastic to see him bowl with such intent. Arshdeep played a key role too. He mentioned the ball was reversing slightly, and even saliva was helping with that.We&rsquo;ve done a lot of groundwork before the season &mdash; left no stone unturned. Everyone&rsquo;s contributing not just with skill, but with mindset and intent. That&rsquo;s what makes the environment really special.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n",

The duo launched a brutal assault in the middle overs, hammering 13 sixes between them and propelling LSG past 200. However, DC clawed back late with <strong>Mitchell Starc (3\/42)<\/strong> and <strong>Kuldeep Yadav (2\/20)<\/strong> keeping things in check. The collapse in the final five overs &mdash; where LSG lost 6 wickets for 46 runs &mdash; ultimately proved costly.<\/p>\n\n<p>In response, Delhi got off to a nightmare start, losing their top three inside the first two overs. But from 7\/3, the Capitals showed remarkable character. <strong>Ashutosh Sharma<\/strong>, promoted as an Impact Player, played the innings of a lifetime, smashing an unbeaten <strong>66 off 31 balls<\/strong>, including 5 sixes and 5 fours.<\/p>\n\n<p>He found support from <strong>Vipraj Nigam (39 off 15)<\/strong> as the pair stitched a crucial 55-run stand that brought DC back into the contest. The game came down to the final over, with 6 needed. Ashutosh, calm under pressure, smoked a six to seal a remarkable win.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/image_1742840838.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Rishabh Pant | Lucknow Super Giants Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;I think we had enough runs on the board. The batters did really well, but we lost some momentum between overs 13 to 17. Still, it was a competitive total on this surface.As a team, we&#39;re looking to take positives from every game. The more we stick to the basics, the better it will be for us going forward.It&rsquo;s quite clear where it slipped away. This was a good wicket to bat on, and they had two key partnerships &mdash; Stubbsy, Ashutosh, and another guy &mdash; that really took the game away from us.As the ball got older, there was more on offer for the bowlers. We felt the pressure in the final phase. It&#39;s still early in the tournament, and while pressure is part of the game, so is learning from moments like this.Of course, luck plays its part. If that ball had missed the pad, it was a stumping chance. But you can&rsquo;t dwell on these things. The focus has to be on playing good, consistent cricket from here on.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Axar Patel | Delhi Capitals Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;Under my captaincy, you might see a few more thrillers like this!&nbsp;We got the win, so let&rsquo;s not overthink things like why Stubbs bowled or anything like that. After losing four wickets inside the powerplay, it was an outstanding effort from the boys to pull it back and chase this down.Since last year, with the impact player rule, we&rsquo;ve seen this shift. Bowlers are getting hit, but they&rsquo;re also picking up wickets. You have to be mentally ready for that &mdash; if you&#39;re being attacked, there&rsquo;s always a chance to strike back.To be honest, we gave away a few extra runs in the powerplay and dropped some catches too. At one point, it looked like they were heading for 240-250. But the way we bowled in the last seven overs &mdash; giving just 40-odd &mdash; that was a brilliant comeback.We&rsquo;ve been in camp for over a week now, and everyone understands each other&rsquo;s strengths. We saw potential in Vipraj Nigam &mdash; and tonight, he showed why we backed him. I&rsquo;m confident he&rsquo;ll keep growing and deliver in the games to come.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Ashutosh Sharma | Player of the Match:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;Honestly, this is something I&rsquo;ve been working on since last season. There were a couple of games where I took it deep but couldn&rsquo;t finish &mdash; got out at the wrong time. That stayed with me, and over the past year, I&rsquo;ve made it a focus &mdash; especially in domestic cricket, trying to finish games consistently.I have a lot of belief in myself. I knew that if I could take it into the last over, anything was possible. In T20 cricket, once the equation narrows down, pressure shifts. I just backed the shots I&rsquo;ve been practicing in the nets &mdash; nothing fancy, just execution and self-belief.First of all, hats off to Vipraj &mdash; what a knock! I just kept telling him: if you&#39;re confident you can find the boundary, back yourself and go for it. We kept talking throughout, kept each other calm, and that made a big difference.More than anything, I just wanted to put into play all the hard work I&#39;ve done in training. I&rsquo;m really happy to contribute and would love to dedicate this award to my mentor, Shikhar Paaji (Dhawan), who&rsquo;s not here today but has played a big role in my journey.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n",

It&rsquo;s the <strong>El Clasico of the IPL<\/strong> as <strong>Chennai Super Kings (CSK) take on Mumbai Indians (MI) in Match No. 3 at Chepauk!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>MI will be led by Suryakumar Yadav,<\/strong> stepping in for Hardik Pandya, who serves a one-match ban for a slow over-rate from last season&rsquo;s final league game. With <strong>Rohit Sharma, Tilak Varma, and SKY<\/strong> forming a formidable batting trio, MI will aim for a strong start. However, the absence of <strong>Jasprit Bumrah for the initial few games<\/strong> could be a concern for them.

The Royals have made <strong>bold moves<\/strong> in their bowling attack, letting go of their iconic trio&mdash;<strong>Ashwin, Chahal, and Boult<\/strong>&mdash;and bringing in the fiery pace of <strong>Jofra Archer<\/strong>, alongside spin wizards <strong>Wanindu Hasaranga and Maheesh Theekshana<\/strong>. Adding to the intrigue is the arrival of <strong>13-year-old prodigy Suryavanshi,<\/strong> making headlines as the youngest-ever IPL recruit!<\/p>\n\n<p>With <strong>firepower on both sides<\/strong>, Hyderabad is bracing for a high-scoring spectacle! <strong>Will SRH make a statement at home, or will RR&rsquo;s revamped squad stun them on their turf?<\/strong> Buckle up for an <strong>edge-of-the-seat thriller<\/strong> as the <strong>IPL carnival continues!<br \/>\n<br \/>\nHead-To-Head in IPL:<\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (1)_1742721671.gif\" \/><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#e67e22\"><strong>Hyderabad &ndash; A Ground Where Trends Are Shifting!<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\nAs <strong>Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Rajasthan Royals (RR)<\/strong> prepare for their <strong>IPL 2025 clash at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium<\/strong>, the stats reveal an intriguing narrative. Historically, <strong>teams chasing have had the upper hand<\/strong>, winning <strong>43 out of 77 matches<\/strong>, while <strong>teams batting first have secured 34 victories<\/strong>. The <strong>average first-innings score has been 163<\/strong>, with teams managing <strong>47 runs in the powerplay<\/strong> and <strong>43 in the death overs<\/strong> on average.<\/p>\n\n<p>But hold on&mdash;<strong>the past two seasons have flipped the script!<\/strong> In the <strong>last 13 IPL games played here<\/strong>, teams batting first have gained an <strong>edge with 7 wins compared to 6 for chasing sides<\/strong>. More importantly, the <strong>batting-friendly conditions have led to an increase in scoring<\/strong>, with the <strong>average first-innings total soaring to 189!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The <strong>powerplay has seen fireworks, with teams now averaging 56 runs<\/strong>, while the <strong>death overs have become even more explosive, pushing the scoring rate to 49 runs on average.<\/strong> Clearly, Hyderabad is no longer just a <strong>chasing-friendly venue<\/strong>&mdash;it&rsquo;s now a <strong>high-scoring battleground<\/strong> where teams will need to rethink their strategies.<\/p>\n\n<p>With SRH&rsquo;s <strong>explosive top order<\/strong> and RR&rsquo;s <strong>revamped power-hitting unit<\/strong>, this match promises to be an absolute run-fest! <strong>Will the trend of big first-innings totals continue, or will the chasing team regain its dominance?<\/strong> Buckle up&mdash;Hyderabad is set for a thrilling contest!<br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report | Mpumelelo Mbangwa and Michael Clarke:<\/strong><br \/>\n&quot;Dimensions-wise, the square boundaries are 63m and 70m, with 76m straight down the ground. The average score at this venue is 205, but on this specific pitch, it&#39;s even higher at 216. In one word, it&rsquo;s a batting paradise &mdash; an absolute belter, and it has been for quite some time.If we&#39;re nitpicking, both ends of the pitch appear slightly dry, while the center has a touch more grass. That could hint at a bit of two-paced behavior or some grip for spinners &mdash; we&rsquo;re hoping! But make no mistake, with this heat and this surface, it&#39;s the batters who will be licking their lips.If you&#39;re batting first here, 200+ should be the minimum target. It&#39;s tough for a surface to deteriorate in a 20-over match, but ideally, the second innings might offer some grip &mdash; slower balls and spin could come into play. Bottom line: expect runs, and lots of them.&quot;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (29)_1742724521.gif\" \/><\/p>\n\n<div><br \/>\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE:&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" \/><span style=\"color:#ff0099\">&nbsp;Won the Toss and Elected to Field First<\/span><span style=\"color:#cc0066\">&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/cricket-ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" \/><\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/div>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">???? ???????????????? ????<br><br>Rajasthan Royals have won the toss and elected to bowl first against Sunrisers Hyderabad at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium.<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/TATAIPL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TATAIPL<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/SRHvRR?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SRHvRR<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SunRisers?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SunRisers<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/rajasthanroyals?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@rajasthanroyals<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/No3UrY6FA4\">pic.twitter.com\/No3UrY6FA4<\/a><\/p>&mdash; IndianPremierLeague (@IPL) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/IPL\/status\/1903743243579539702?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 23, 2025<\/a><\/blockquote> <script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n",

The charge was led by the ever-destructive <strong>Ishan Kishan<\/strong>, who blazed his way to an <strong>unbeaten 106 off just 47 balls<\/strong>. He was well supported by <strong>Travis Head (67 off 39)<\/strong> and <strong>Nitish Reddy (30 off 15)<\/strong>, as SRH&rsquo;s top order tore apart the Royals&#39; bowling.<\/p>\n\n<p>Despite <strong>RR&rsquo;s bold bowling changes this season<\/strong>, including pace spearhead <strong>Jofra Archer<\/strong> and mystery spinner <strong>Theekshana<\/strong>, their attack had no answers. <strong>Tushar Deshpande<\/strong> tried to pull things back with <strong>3 wickets<\/strong>, but the scoreboard pressure was already massive.<\/p>\n\n<p>Chasing 287, <strong>RR began disastrously<\/strong>, losing <strong>Jaiswal and skipper Riyan Parag<\/strong> in the very first two overs.

I think we could&rsquo;ve executed our plans a lot better, and that&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;ll sit down and discuss as a team.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0099\"><strong>(On choosing to bowl first):<br \/>\n&quot;It was a collective decision. The idea was to use the slower balls and bouncers more effectively, but we definitely could&rsquo;ve done a better job with that.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0099\"><strong>&quot;When you&#39;re chasing 280, it&rsquo;s always going to be tough. Honestly, I felt a target around 220&ndash;240 would have been more manageable.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0099\"><strong>&quot;That said, the batters looked great &mdash; Sanju bhaiya gave us a good start, Dhruv Jurel played a superb innings, and Sandeep bowled really well. Lots of positives to take from this match. Win or lose, we&rsquo;ll take the learnings and move forward.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pat Cummins (Sunrisers Hyderabad Captain):<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong><span style=\"color:#d35400\">(On being called the most feared side in the IPL):<br \/>\n&quot;I&rsquo;ll take that! Honestly, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be bowling to our batters &mdash; they&rsquo;re unbelievable. Putting up 280-plus is scary. You know you&#39;re going to go for runs, and it&#39;s never easy out there. But when you have that kind of total, one big over can change the game in your favor.&quot;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#d35400\">&quot;We&#39;ve largely retained our core group, and I&rsquo;m really happy with the new additions. Ishan was just incredible today &mdash; what a knock!&quot;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#d35400\">&quot;The preparation leading into the season has been top-notch. Credit to our coaches &mdash; they&#39;ve been fantastic. Everyone came in fit and firing. We&rsquo;ve created an environment where guys are encouraged to play with freedom &mdash; and while that&rsquo;s easier said than done, the results speak for themselves.&quot;<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Ishan Kishan (Player of the Match):<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong><span style=\"color:#d35400\">&quot;To be honest, there were nerves definitely. But looking at the score and the team setup, Pat and the coach gave me a lot of confidence. They told me, &#39;Just believe in yourself and enjoy out there.&#39; And that&rsquo;s exactly what I did &mdash; I just enjoyed my time in the middle.&quot;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#d35400\">&quot;I had a good amount of time off between games, and I worked really hard during that period. I gave it everything in practice. A few close people stood by me and helped me stay focused. I just believed in my game and backed myself.&quot;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#d35400\">(On whether he wants to carry this pitch with him everywhere):<br \/>\n&quot;100 percent! When you see Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head batting the way they did, and you&#39;re coming in at No. 3, it gives you so much confidence. You know you can take your time because those two won&rsquo;t stop. You&rsquo;re either walking in very early or with a huge total already on the board &mdash; both situations help you settle in.&quot;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#d35400\">&quot;Of course, posting these kinds of totals every match is tough. But Pat knows what&rsquo;s best for the team. The message is clear &mdash; go out, play with freedom, and enjoy yourself. Don&rsquo;t worry about getting out &mdash; just express yourself.&quot;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n",

Alongside <strong>Livingstone, Tim David, and Kohli<\/strong>, RCB&rsquo;s batting arsenal looks nothing short of firepower.<\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\nBut the Knights are ready to defend their fortress! <strong>Venkatesh Iyer<\/strong>, KKR&rsquo;s biggest acquisition, will be their key player, while the legendary duo of <strong>Andre Russell and Sunil Narine<\/strong> remains the backbone of their success. Can they deliver yet again?<\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\n<strong>Who will draw first blood in IPL 2025? Will KKR start their title defense with a bang, or will RCB spoil the party at Eden?<\/strong> Get ready for a night of <strong>thrills, fireworks, and nail-biting drama<\/strong> as two of the league&rsquo;s powerhouses collide in a dream opener!&nbsp;<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Head-to-Head in IPL:<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width_1742566215.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\">Eden Gardens &ndash; A Batting Paradise or a Test of Strategy?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\nAs <strong>KKR and RCB<\/strong> gear up for the <strong>IPL 2025 opener<\/strong>, all eyes will be on the pitch at <strong>Eden Gardens<\/strong>, a venue known for its electric atmosphere and shifting trends. Over the years, teams <strong>chasing have held the edge<\/strong>, winning <strong>55 out of 93 games<\/strong>, compared to <strong>38 victories for teams batting first<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Historically, the <strong>average first-innings score here stands at 167<\/strong>, with a <strong>powerplay average of 49 runs<\/strong> and a <strong>death overs surge of 45 runs<\/strong>. However, the past <strong>three seasons have rewritten the script!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>In the <strong>last 16 IPL games<\/strong> at this venue, teams batting first and second have split the wins <strong>evenly at 8 each<\/strong>, signaling a <strong>balanced contest<\/strong>. More significantly, the <strong>average first-innings total has skyrocketed to 196<\/strong>, proving that Eden Gardens is no longer just about chasing&mdash;it&rsquo;s now a <strong>big-hitting paradise!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>With power-packed lineups on both sides, <strong>will KKR&rsquo;s all-rounders dominate the show, or will RCB&rsquo;s batting might make Eden their own?<\/strong> One thing is certain&mdash;<strong>fans are in for a run-fest!<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\">The Big Battles:<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 - Battles to watch out for_1742645287.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\nTOSS UPDATE: <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/RCB-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp;Won the Toss and Elected to Field first&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" \/><\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

In what was billed as a highly anticipated opener, RCB outclassed the home side in all departments, signaling the beginning of a new era under captain Rajat Patidar.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>After winning the toss and opting to bowl first, RCB had an early scare when Suyash Sharma dropped a sitter in the opening over, giving Quinton de Kock a life. However, Josh Hazlewood dismissed him a few balls later, ensuring the drop didn&rsquo;t cost them. KKR bounced back with a brilliant 103-run stand between new skipper Ajinkya Rahane and Sunil Narine. Rahane looked elegant in his 56 off 31, while Narine bludgeoned 44 off 26. But once Narine fell to Rasikh Dar Salam, the innings lost momentum. Krunal Pandya took charge with the ball, picking 3 for 29, and KKR stumbled to 174\/8.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>In response, RCB&rsquo;s chase was nothing short of explosive. Phil Salt, facing his former team, went ballistic in the powerplay, scoring 56 off 31 balls, while Virat Kohli, playing his 400th T20 match, remained unbeaten on 59 from 36 deliveries. The pair&rsquo;s 80-run opening stand in six overs completely deflated the KKR attack. Despite losing Salt and Padikkal, Patidar smashed a 16-ball 34, and Livingstone wrapped things up with a rapid 15* off 5 balls.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>RCB&#39;s intent was clear &mdash; fearless batting, tight bowling, and capitalizing on big moments. For KKR, this was a wake-up call, especially with the ball, as they failed to defend a competitive total. As the tournament begins to unfold, RCB already look like a well-oiled unit ready to go the distance.<\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/Match no 1_1742665294.png\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\n<strong>Ajinkya Rahane | Kolkata Knight Riders Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>&quot;I thought we were in a strong position until around the 13th over, but then we lost two to three wickets in quick succession, and the momentum completely shifted. It&rsquo;s just the first game of the season, so we&rsquo;ll assess things quickly and move forward.Yes, while I was batting with Venkatesh, we felt 210&ndash;220 was very much on the cards. But credit to RCB &mdash; they bowled exceptionally well in the latter half of our innings.There was a bit of dew, yes, but more than that, I think they batted brilliantly in the powerplay. As I mentioned earlier, a total of 170&ndash;180 on this surface was below par. We were targeting 200-plus, and not getting early breakthroughs with the ball really hurt us tonight.That said, we&rsquo;re not going to dwell too much on this result. It&rsquo;s a long season. We&rsquo;ll regroup, improve as a unit, and come back stronger in the upcoming matches.&quot;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Rajat Patidar | Royal Challengers &nbsp;Bengaluru&nbsp;Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;There was definitely pressure, but it turned out to be a good day for me &mdash; and if we keep playing like this, I hope there are many more to come.The plan was very clear. I wanted the wicket of Andre Russell at any cost. Even if Suyash went for a few runs, I backed him as our strike bowler &mdash; and he delivered. That moment was crucial.Both Krunal and Suyash deserve massive credit. KKR were flying around the 13th over, but the way they pulled things back was simply brilliant. Their composure turned the game in our favour.It&rsquo;s also a great feeling to lead someone like Virat Kohli &mdash; he&rsquo;s incredibly supportive and having that kind of experience in the camp helps a lot. I&rsquo;m learning every day with this group of leaders around me.&nbsp;Yeah, that was actually a premeditated shot &mdash; I was aiming to go over cover, but the ball nipped back a bit, and it ended up flying over backward point instead. Luckily, it worked out!&quot;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Krunal Pandya | Player of the Match:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;Honestly, nothing much &mdash; I just realised that with so much crowd noise, it&rsquo;s important to narrow your focus. When I came back to bowl my second over, I zoned in and just focused on delivering good balls. I&rsquo;m happy I could step up and contribute for the team.In T20s, if batters want to go big, they&rsquo;ll have to do it against my best deliveries. That&rsquo;s the mindset. These days, batters have so many options and skills &mdash; as a bowler, you&rsquo;ve got to keep evolving with the game. Everyone talks about changes of pace &mdash; usually about pacers &mdash; but for spinners too, variation in speed is a powerful weapon. I&rsquo;ve got a wide yorker and even a bouncer in my toolkit, and Jitesh Sharma is well aware of that. He&rsquo;s always ready, which gives me the confidence to execute those variations when needed. Joining RCB has been incredible. The energy around this franchise is unreal. Even when I played domestic cricket in Bengaluru, I could hear RCB chants from the stands. It&rsquo;s been only ten days with the squad, but it already feels like something special.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n",

      "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>The Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 resumes today with a high-stakes clash between Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium. RCB, currently second on the points table with 16 points from 11 matches, aim to solidify their playoff position and potentially reclaim the top spot. KKR, placed sixth with 11 points from 12 games, face a must-win scenario to keep their playoff hopes alive.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nRCB&rsquo;s batting lineup is bolstered by Virat Kohli, who has amassed 505 runs this season. He partners with Phil Salt, who has scored 239 runs at a strike rate of 168.31 in IPL 2025. Captain Rajat Patidar is expected to play despite a recent finger injury. Bhuvneshwar Kumar leads the pace attack in the bowling department with 12 wickets, while Krunal Pandya offers economical spin options. &nbsp;<br \/>\nKKR&rsquo;s batting has been inconsistent, relying heavily on Ajinkya Rahane and young talent Angkrish Raghuvanshi. Andre Russell&rsquo;s recent form, including a match-winning 57* against Rajasthan Royals, provides a boost. Sunil Narine and Varun Chakravarthy will be key in the spin department.<br \/>\nThe Chinnaswamy pitch traditionally favours batters, However, weather forecasts predict a 70% chance of rain, which could disrupt play. &nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\nRCB holds a slight edge with home advantage and recent form, but KKR&rsquo;s desperation and potential for explosive performances make this a contest to watch.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width_1747488165.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\nIPL Stats at Chinnaswamy Stadium in 2025:<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 - 2025-05-17T183813_1747488460.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n",
