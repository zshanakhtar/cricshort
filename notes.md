how does the iplt20 website load its data?

It uses JSONP (JSON with Padding) to load data from a different domain. JSONP is a method used to request data from a server in a different domain than the client. It works by adding a `<script>` tag to the HTML document, which allows the browser to fetch and execute JavaScript code from the server. The server responds with a JavaScript function call, which is executed by the browser.
